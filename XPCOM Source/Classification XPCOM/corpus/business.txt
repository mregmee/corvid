Badri,

In the event DPC signs the contract, we would need to make it Indian tax 
efficient. PLease suggest the structure/clauses/information required by which 
we need not pay withholding taxes. If you need more info on the scope of work 
contemplated you can talk to Wade/Neil/Sandeep.

Wade/Mohan,

Please find below the last draft copy of the Henwood Consulting Agreement.  
We need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ENE policies.

As you will see, the draft Agreement is made out with Enron in mind, even 
though we have left the company name blank in the agreement.

Mohan - Last when we spoke (Friday), you were going to explore the tax 
aspects of having DPC be the signing company.  Please tell us if that works.

Separately, you and Wade may need to consider how DPC lenders may look upon 
some of the information emerging from this study, and whether you want all of 
it in lender domain.

Based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be EIPL, ENE 
Houston, or DPC.  We could also have a version where ENE Houston is signing 
the contract on behalf of DPC.

Please let me know what you decide, and we will proceed accordingly.  If you 
would like someone in EIPL/DPC to be signing the contract, please let me 
know, who the signing authority is.  I suspect, that even I could sign on 
behalf of DPC or ENE ??  If so, I will be in Houston on Wednesday, and sign 
at the time.  If not, you can assign someone to sign.

Regards,
Sandeep.

anyone from Tax involved in this?  If not, we need to get someone in the

Hey Guys - can you help please?

I need an good accountant to help set-up and run a &apos;Real Estate &amp; 
Co-Location&apos; Book for EBS. Full time - senior specialist level.

I&apos;ve tried the &apos;market&apos; - but it&apos;s thin. Can you help? Can you assign be 
somebody from Corp or someplace else for the rest of the year?

Thanks.

Todd,
 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
&quot;Thunderball&quot; project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock&apos;s valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.

Kathryn has done a good job of keeping me in the loop on this.  In addition, Kim has consistently provided useful, objective feedback, as shown in the memo attached below. 

We will produce a stable code with the changes Kim and her team have requested before the package is released outside the building.

I have also asked Kathryn to perform more testing within the CL team before asking Kim and her team (or any other clients) to play with the changes.  Performing significant changes overnight, and then showing the code to clients the next morning is wonderfully responsive, but a little too risky.

The high-level demo scheduled for Thursday will show code that is already frozen and hardened.

All the best,

Tom

Subject:	Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were &quot;show stoppers&quot; as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the &quot;fixes&quot; and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the &quot;new&quot; streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Kim Theriot  





I have received preliminary information from D&amp;B.  I think several 
issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better 
solution for the money.  

Option 1
The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to 
monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.

Option 2
I wasn&apos;t sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If 
you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :
 
 2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores 
that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per 
record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently 
with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive 
alternative 
        (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).

 2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be 
provided monthly.  D&amp;B is working on a solution that would provide a 
weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has 
not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates 
than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to 
transactionally access records one at a time using D&amp;B&apos;s software.  The cost 
for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score. 

Option 3
D&amp;B Connect Product.
 D&amp;B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated 
reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&amp;B services that 
enables the  most effective integration of customer information and 
third-party information with D&amp;B information.  Only this type of process and 
information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate 
identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer&apos;s complete 
relationship.   In addition, D&amp;B Connect  assures organizations of 
referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&amp;B so 
that the most recent D&amp;B information is always  transmitted to your 
organization and updated within your local D&amp;B Connect Reference File.  D&amp;B 
Connect is scalable.  

 Cost Typically ranging from
 * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000
 * CAM Online - $50,000
 * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data

With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.


Questions/Issues

1) D&amp;B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron 
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained 
that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers, 
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available 
externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this 
understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be 
imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be 
negotiated.

2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  
Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score reference  above were explored as an example.

3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?

4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. 
companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of 
default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This 
rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  
This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this 
score in a batch manner.

5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit 
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is 
probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if 
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&amp;B will see decreased 
usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

 If you would like me to follow up further, please give me a call at 
Dear All,

Yesterday, I mentioned to Vince the inhouse modelling capabilities and the 
impact weather and the weather forecast can have on some of Enron&apos;s 
operations and Risk Management positions. For this reason I have attached 
three files, two of those show to tropical cyclones off the coasts of 
Australia, i.e. Rachel and Drena. Tropical cyclones pose a significant risk, 
and an early warning system can be part of a better risk strategy. 
Please, note that the modelling system has been further improved since the 
simulation was done. 

Also, we can focus on another large problem and associated risk. Dust storms 
can pose a significant risk to a number of industries, and the prediction 
of such events has been very difficult, if not impossible. For this reason a 
GIS database has been developed and coupled to the NWP model, which 
allows prediction of such events in realtime. For the depicted event an 
estimated 6 million tonnes of top soil was lost, and with it $$. 

Maybe we can set up a conference call to discuss

* the above mentioned points
* further improvments in forecasting based on the high resolution forecasts
* weather and climate on a global perspective for Enron
* how to further improve the forecast for Enron

Regards,
Christian

I&apos;d like to get together as a group and discuss both Commodity Logic &amp; DCAF 
projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for 
supporting the trade clearing functions.  Here are the items I&apos;d like to 
initially discuss:

Commodity Logic Deliverables, timing and perhaps a demo or screen shots to 
show where we currently are in our development.
Current DCAF requests and current areas of pain communicated from the user 
side.
Legal &amp; Credit concerns or issues known at this time.

Once we have put together a strawman or high level plan then let&apos;s follow up 
with the larger user community and see if this address the highest priority 
concerns that were brought up at the Deal Clearing JAD session. 

 Cheryl:  Please set up an hour and a half meeting with the people addressed 
under cc: above to discuss the subject listed above.  I&apos;d like to meet ASAP 
and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled 

The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the 
DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and 
Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for 
trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 
22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official 
business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as 
long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.

Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 
22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for 
December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a 
preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that 
you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on 
Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your 
best estimate of trading results.

Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information 
for the worldwide trading organization.  I hope that all of you enjoy your 
holidays.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron&apos;s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers&apos; needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron&apos;s preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National&apos;s and Alamo&apos;s preferred traveler programs.  National&apos;s Emerald Club membership and Alamo&apos;s Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&amp;E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com &lt;http://gss.enron.com/&gt;.

I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 
7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during 
trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that 
everything will be covered.  

I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer 
trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest 
idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will 
take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the 
office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if 
we decide that is needed.

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of &quot;what if&apos;s.&quot;  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the

Bob is a good, solid player.  He won&apos;t change the world, but he is diligent 
about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am 
very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His 
wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we 
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order 
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able 
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a 
caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment 
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and 
predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will 
personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he 
ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  

Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what 
impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be 
better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL 
transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that 
they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with 
Brent.  --Sally

The next meeting has changed dates. Please mark your calenders for
Sunday, June 4, 2000 at Guadalara&apos;s restaurant at 4:30 pm.

Thanks,

As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company 
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk 
associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and 
power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know 
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward 

Chris can set up a conference call with myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu 
to discuss
the real option applications. My assistant Shirley Crenshaw, 3-5290, will be 
glad to help him.

Hi Jodi,

I have been remiss in keeping up with you and letting you know what is
going on
in my little world here at Kellogg.

In other matters, life at Kellogg has me very busy at the moment.  I am taking
a full load, including Fin Decisions and am helping Prof. Petersen write a new
class called Advanced Valuation, which will be offered in the spring.  A big
part of the focus of this class is going to be on real options, which is cool
stuff.  And as poor as my timing is, I would like to ask you a
question/favor.
For purposes of this class, do you think it would be possible to obtain
some of
Enron&apos;s thoughts on real options?  I was thinking, for example, that a
fuel-switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet.  Of
course, none of the numbers or names need be real-- only the concepts.  Well,
let me know what you think of that-- who knows, Enron might actually like the
free exposure.


All the best,

Thanks for agreeing to act as the PRC representative for the Associates and 
Analysts.  The PRC for the Western hemisphere will be held on July 19, 2000.  

Joe Sutton and I will hold an information session on Friday, June 16th at 
9:30 a.m., in conference room 49C4.   We will provide information regarding 
the process for the PRC and a list of the Associates or Analysts that you 
will be representing.  Please let me know whether you will attend  via e-mail 
or at ext. 3-9523 as soon as possible.  If you need to attend via conference 
call please take note of the following information:

Dial In Number: (877) 288-4427
International Access: (734) 414-0267
Participant code: 827937


I have just returned to the office, and am making it through my E-mails 
gradually.  It seems that Clickpaper.com is the concern of this memo.  I am 
not up to speed on this European effort.  I suggest this:  I would suggest a 
conference call to discuss.  I would also like for Clickpapaer to be there, 
so if you provide me a name of your Clickpapaer contact, I&apos;ll make sure they 
are included.  Also please provide an assistant&apos;s name, and I&apos;ll have Yvette 
schedule the call.

In the meantime, I&apos;ll talk with the Clickpaper people here to get up to speed 
on their plans.

Thanks for the E-mail.

At the meeting I was told 2 weeks to a month out.  I think they would like to 
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention, but they still 
have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so 
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple 
of days (after they chase down some legal and tax issues).  In the meantime, 
we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details 
as soon as possible.  As you know, Global Products is currently only 
supporting 10-15 financial trades per month (confirms and settlements through 
ECTRIC).

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
We anticipate the call will last less than one hour.

Hey Melanie--To cut to the case, J. Zampano is going to enter his own order
re discovery schedule because parties could not reach agreement.  He will
issue written order that calls for cutoff  of all written discovery to be
served on Jan 12 and answer by Feb 23.  After Feb 23 fact witnesses can be
deposed until July 31.  From Aug 1 to Oct 15 expert discovery is to be
completed.  There will be certain months designated for plaintiff to take
depos and other months for Defendants.  Defandants get more months.   Above
is guestimate as Judge Zampano was still thinking about final dates etc.
Most interesting part came at end of day when Judge talked to parties
separately.  Judge wanted to know what it would take to get group to discuss
settlement.  General consensus was that defendants wanted plaintiffs to be
put to their proof on insolveny issue and provide basis for damages.  Idea
is that Judge will hold status conf on Jan 16 and will push that idea with
the plaintiff.
Obviously I think there is a good chance Enron will be out of it by then
because I think the Plaintiff is very anxious to settlewith any party will
ot sit down with the trustee.
One last thing.  Greenswag was nagging me aout Enron&apos;s payment of share of
jt. defense costs.  I said I would pass his request on to you--so I am.
Good Luck with settlement discussions tomorrow.

................................................

Bruce,

I am a little late answering your attached e-mail.

Brian Barth met with Mike Swartz in the first half of 2000 in his capacity as
counsel for Oaktree and in the context of Oaktree&apos;s written agreement, and
Mike&apos;s oral agreement, that Oaktree&apos;s counsel would not disclose to, or use
for, Farallon anything learned from Barth in the meeting (which meeting
Oaktree insisted take place pursuant to the parties&apos; written agreement.)

In direct violation of the written and oral agreements, Shawna Ballard
thereafter disclosed the Barth/Swartz meeting on the public record in Barth&apos;s
deposition and began asserting statements in the deposition that Brian had
allegedly made to Mike.  (Shawna&apos;s factual assertions about what Brian said
were in fact wrong, but that is beside the point.)  Until Shawna made her
disclosures, none of the defendants was even aware that the meeting had taken
place.  Now, as a result of Shawna&apos;s disclosures, in a variety of ways the
other defendants have initiated formal and informal discovery against Enron
and are otherwise taking positions adverse to Enron.  Enron intends to hold
Oaktree responsible for all damages arising out of its breach of its written
agreement with Enron, including Enron&apos;s substantially increased attorneys fees
in the various litigations.



&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;MacLeodB@hbdlawyers.com&quot; 04/04/01 03:18PM &gt;&gt;&gt;
Steve -- I am having a little trouble understanding the complaints stated in
your two e-mails repeated below.

With regard to the Barth deposition, Section 2.01 of the parties&apos;
cooperation agreement expressly authorizes Oaktree to reveal information
obtained from ECT to potential witnesses or even as exhibits in depositions.

With regard to our document production, Section 2.01 again specifically
authorizes us to provide documents or information obtained from ECT in
responding to discovery requests.  Moreover, we know of no know proper
privilege objection that would have allowed us to withhold any of the
materials we have produced in response to NatWest&apos;s subpoena.  Our production 
in response to NatWest&apos;s subpoena is substantially complete.
If, after you have reviewed that production, you continue to believe that we
are in error with regard to the Oaktree/ECT agreement or the proper scope of
our production, give me a call and we discuss it.  Thanks Steve.

Request No 1, I would like the opportunity to review the docs.

We believe that Oaktree breached its agreement with Enron when Shawna
disclosed in the middle of Barth&apos;s deposition that Mike Swartz had met with
Barth and further disclosed (inaccurately, we believe) portions of the
content
of that meeting.  We would hope that Oaktree is not on the verge of a
further
breach. Steve Howard

Elizabeth, I&apos;m going to forward to you and Richard a few emails recently
circulated by the joint defense group in which an overview of the Trust&apos;s
damage argument is outlined and ideas exchanged about it.  Knowing you&apos;re
buried with other matters, if there is any chance you could review
them/print them out &amp; review and give me a call so that we can discuss, I&apos;d
greatly appreciate it.    The description of what the defense group is
anticipating appears to be consistent with what the Trust told us in one of
our early conference calls about how it was calculating damages in our
case.  I&apos;d like to know if you agree or if there are difference in what our
Master Agreement/confirmation letters damage provisions provide.  I would
also like to review the counterarguments that we&apos;ve articulated in brief
before.

If you&apos;d like to schedule a set time to talk over the next few days, that&apos;s
great; let me know what works for you.  Feel free to call me at any time
and we can discuss.

Thanks.

Re:   PCA Litigation/Trustee&apos;s Damage Theory

Dear Counsel:

Having reviewed Tim&apos;s email and talking with him, I reiterate my view that
Tim has correctly determined how the A&amp;K attorneys are going to stand up
and
claim that PCA&apos;s inability to perform is irrelevant.  While I maintain that
the argument leads to an absurd result (namely that PCA could
repudiate/breach the contracts and still collect damages), it may be that
we
need an expert to analyze the LD provisions of the contracts to aid us in
our response.

It would be interesting to know what our clients&apos; think about this argument
or what Scott Jones thinks of it.  For example, can PCA claim that sellers
who appropriatedly demanded adequate assurance &quot;failed&quot; to schedule or
deliver power when they proposed to continue to schedule/deliver once
adequate assurance was posted.  Similarly, would a trading expert interpret
the LD provision relating to having a seller&apos;s performance &quot;excused&quot; by PCA
to be limited to situations where PCA and the seller were &quot;booking out&quot; or
PCA was otherwise making affirmative statements to the seller that delivery
was not expected?

Any thoughts?

Regards.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron&apos;s right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy&apos;s exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

I will let you know when I hear something regarding these type of contracts.

Sally and Scott Earnest called this afternoon.  We will be setting up a new 
risk book to manage LNG positions on a worldwide basis.  Supposedly, there 
are several contracts from the old E.I. entity related to India for LNG.  
They may reference Dabhol Power project, fuel management, fuel oil, heating 
oil....

Scott desperately needs to get copies of these contracts.  Can you ask around 
with some of the contacts you made on your India trip to see if you can find 

We have delivered a copy of 2 LNG contracts to Scott Earnest&apos;s office 
tonight. One is between Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company Limited &amp; Dabhol 
Power Company and the other is between Dabhol Power Company and Oman LNG 
L.L.C.   I understand the EGEP Legal group (Steve Watson) is currently 
working on a third contract but it is not executed at this time. He has 
advised that he will forward a copy when it is completed.
