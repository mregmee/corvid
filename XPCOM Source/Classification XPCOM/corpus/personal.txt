Instead of going to the haunted house, we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved.  The weather is going to nice and cool, so the
plan is to have a fire, eat and then play &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;.  We will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side. The goal of the game is to find  your team&apos;s flag
and bring it safely back to your side.  Of course, it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky, because if you get caught on your opponent&apos;s side, then
you have to wait until you are freed.  It is a very fun game, but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people&apos;s personalities.  If
you aren&apos;t up to playing the game, then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours.

Stages Theatre presents 

&quot;Romance/Romance&quot;
(Book and Lyrics by Bary Harman
Music by Keith Herrmann)

This sophisticated musical celebrates courtship, love and fidelity in two very different centuries as lovers discover the timeless truths of romantic relationships.

Act One:  VIENNA, 1890 - A dashing aristocrat and a fiery young woman, unsatisfied with their lackluster love lives, take on new identities in hopes of finding true love.  Under these false pretenses they meet and form an attachment - but can their romance survive the truth?

Act Two:  THE HAMPTONS, Present Day - A vacation in the Hamptons seems like the perfect setting for armour  for two happily-married couples-but will they end up sharing more than a summer home?  Find out in this uproarious study of the joys and complexities of modern romance.

This musical received 5 Tony nominations.  The New York Times calls it &quot;smart, bubbly and ardent&quot; and the New York Post calls it &quot;a double-dollop of the romantic spirit.&quot;

Where: 		Stages Theatre
				www.stagestheatre.com

Michelle,
?
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.? Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out.?
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.? 
?
I&apos;m not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.? They aren&apos;t the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them.?
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing. Hi, Sal.   Just thinking about the weekend . . .  Any ideas for what we
should do?  Is there a fun place to go to dinner on Saturday?   Sunday is
Father&apos;s Day - are you going to want to go to church? (should we bring
clothes?)     Last time I visited you, I decided I would keep the Houston
directions somewhere - but, of course, I don&apos;t know where that is.   So,
could you send me directions yet one more time?  THanks!    Love, Cara

Hello, sistas-

Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine&apos;s House.   Here&apos;s some
additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:

1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event.

2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3
entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery&apos;s chef has
cookin&apos; that night.

3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?

4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they
are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be
served as guests arrive.

5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine.   I told her I&apos;d check with you - but that we wouldn&apos;t be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple.

Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest

Hi, Sal.   Just talked with Cindy and she said you&apos;re still trying to work
out weekend plans.   I want to reiterate that, although it would be great to
have you here, please don&apos;t make it too hard on yourself.  Don&apos;t pressure
yourself to come; I will totally understand if you do not.   If you don&apos;t
come this weekend, I bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy
is sure to erupt in the near future!    Either way is great.

Just had to go get some more clothes (at Motherhood)  . . . since I am
carrying all of my weight in my belly, it has expanded to epic proportions
and I cannot fit into my pants!

Set up the baby bedding this weekend - it looks really cute!    But I
couldn&apos;t figure out what do with the mattress pads (what do the cords fit
around?)   Instead I put that cottony thing with the netting on as a
mattress pad.   Is that what it is for?    I know you explained all of this
to us in December, but we could not take it all in at that time!    love, c.
Ok--being the one that probably doesn&apos;t really have the dollars to do this I
would still say &quot;yes&quot;----will try to make room on a credit card for
this--have until June so I think it is ok.....

Will call the picture lady tomorrow and see what the price would be for
that--will email you the results.

Hi, sistas-

Here&apos;s the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed &quot;17&quot; with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d&apos;oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here&apos;s a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn&apos;t go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

Hi, Sally...

Wanted to apologize for the way I probably sounded on the phone--lots was
going on here and you caught me at a brain-overload moment!

Thanks for sending the Enron article--thought it was great--brought it in to
the office to show you off here...

Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can&apos;t really believe how old
they look.  Brigeda&apos;s has taken possession of them and put them on her
bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her
Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week
and will send you one--last year&apos;s was so dorky we didn&apos;t circulate them
much...

Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was
a little stronger--he&apos;s on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving
him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn&apos;t loopy just not
quite so tense.   He seemed very &quot;up&quot; for the dr&apos;s appt in Houston.  I told
him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your
church and did Meagan&apos;s tonsils.  He liked all of that information a
lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could
get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the
pressure is on!

Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you
guys next weekend.

Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we&apos;ll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we&apos;ll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she&apos;s pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week&apos;s issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,
Dear Sally,

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan&apos;s Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the
game we attended last year too.  We have meetings, the other two dates, so if
that still works for you we will plan on that date.  It also gives Dad a bit
more time to hopefully get his voice.  He returns to &quot;DR&quot; Bob Raley, week
after next for the results of all the testing he did this week.

Glad you will be over on Tuesday-we will look forward to seeing you then and
glad you will have time for a visit after lunch tool.

Love,

Dear Sally and Cindy,

Just received an invitation to Dot&apos;s birthday party which the Baptist Church
in Hallettsville is giving for her.  The party will be on September 9th at
10:30 AM at church, and Dot&apos;s children are inviting us to the house
afterwards.  I will forward a copy of the invitation to  you.  Just wanted to
get the date to you now.

Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally  

Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I&apos;m sure some day 
she&apos;ll bring me some pain, but I&apos;m not thinking about that right now.  I 
didn&apos;t know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person 
(better) because of her.  
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she 
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She&apos;s quite a good little eater.  We 
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We&apos;ll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I&apos;ll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I 
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here&apos;s the pictures.....(by 
Good God ---- where do you find time for all of that. You  should write a book when the kids go off to college. By then you should have  many many stories.
 
By the way what is your new address? I may want to come by  some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack. Watching you work sounds better  than anything on TV.
 
You will make a good trader. Good relationships and flexible  pricing are all you need. Oh, and a few zillion other intangibles you will  run into. It beats the hell out of most other things though.
 
I&apos;ll let you be for now, but do keep those stories coming ----  we love them.

I just wanted to send a quick congratulatory note on your promotion to 
Managing Director.  And a bit belated, a thank you for serving again as my 
PRC representative.  I was pleased with my outcome at year-end, and once 
again, was one of the few Analysts or Associates who was always kept informed 
about the process.  I appreciate your time and energy in representing me.

Congratulations on your recent well deserved promotion to Managing 
Director.   I hope everything continues to go well for you and you continue 
to enjoy meeting the challenges of our organization.

***PLAYBOY SEEKING &quot;WOMEN OF ENRON&quot; FOR PICTORIAL LAYOUT
   Saying its goal is to give Enron&apos;s female employees an opportunity that
could &quot;lead them down a new career path,&quot; Playboy magazine has launched a
national campaign seeking women willing to shed their clothing for an upcoming
pictorial layout entitled &quot;Women of Enron.&quot;
   &quot;When one door closes, another one opens,&quot; said Playboy&apos;s photo director
Gary Cole, referring to the collapse of Enron and along with it, most of its
employee&apos;s savings.
   And so far the response has been phenomenal according to the Playboy
spokesperson.
   &quot;We&apos;ve put the press release out five hours ago and the amount of
interested women is substantial,&quot; Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeh Norris told
OPIS. &quot;We have no limit on how many Enron women we&apos;ll use in the layout.&quot;
   Norris added that Playboy hopes to have issue out as soon as possible and
is pushing for a summer release.
   To be eligible candidates must be at least 18 years of age and be able to
document their employment at Enron, along with a valid birth certificate and
photo ID. A recent photo in a two-piece swimsuit and a head-and-shoulders
portrait is also required.
   For additional information, call 312-373-2758.

GOOD NEWS!!!!!
I contacted Schlitterbahn about a two-day ticket for next year and they told me that it is not well advertised but if you want a second-day ticket all you have to do is go to the admissions booth, show them your ticket for the current day or arm band and you will be able to purchase the second-day ticket for:  Adult $16.62, Child $12.07.  This is the only way you can get a reduced ticket for the second day.  Get the second-day ticket as you go in because the admission booth closes at 6 pm.  That is not all the second-day ticket can be used anytime, it does not have to be used the next day.

One of the things we like to do here at Expedia is help you
maximize your vacation dollar. Since accommodations are a
big part of every vacation, we went to more than 1,200 quality
hotels in more than 240 cities and negotiated hotel rates up to
70% less than the average standard rates. We call these Expedia
Special Rates, and it&apos;s all about saving you money. When you
search for a hotel on Expedia.com, just look for the &quot;Expedia
Special Rates&quot; icon and you&apos;ll know you&apos;re getting this special rate.

Right now, you can take advantage of an Expedia Special Rate

This is Cara&apos;s assistant, Cara White.   Cara asked me to send you her
itinerary:

Cara will be in New York for a week.

Thursday through Saturday, she will stay at the Edison Hotel (212) 840-5000

Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn&apos;t know
the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don&apos;t have
time to look it up.)

Also, until Sunday, you may try her husband&apos;s cell phone (512) 657-1555

You can always try Cara&apos;s cell phone (512) 970-0608 - but she hasn&apos;t really
figured out how to retrieve messages yet - so you&apos;ll probably have better
luck leaving a message at the hotel.

Cara will return on Thursday evening on American Flight #1669, arriving at
4:25 P.M.
