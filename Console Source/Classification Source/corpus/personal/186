
Jana,

&quot;Cotton Mary&quot; sounds good. It&apos;s a film by Ismail Merchant who collaborated
on &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, &quot;Howard&apos;s View&quot;, and other well known movies.
It&apos;s a story about two Anglo-Indian sisters.

Vince,

The Angelika has several movies that would be good.  I am familiar with all
but one--&quot;Cotton Mary.&quot;  Do you know anything about it?

If you still haven&apos;t seen &quot;American Beauty&quot;, that is fine with us.  Just let
me know what sounds good to you. We are  flexible when it comes to movies.
