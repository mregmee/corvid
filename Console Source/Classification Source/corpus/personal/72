Linux web servers, and it&apos;s best to be universal, in case they want to
deploy in diff. contexts.

So that we can avoid last minute &quot;oh my gosh we&apos;ve used different file
structures/naming convention--quick we need to change all of these paths in
the next ten minutes&quot;, can we do the following?

All html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the
extension of &quot;.htm&quot;


images--images for Sales Guide and Intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable, such as logos, navigation buttons, etc.  So an

scripts--one script folder for all of the Coursebuilder scripts used in the
deliverable

timer--for the timer interaction that Daniel is building

images/mollie--for images specific to Mollie pages (this way if we have more
than one drag/drop we won&apos;t have to rename any Coursebuilder created
images/targets, etc.

images/warren

images/sally

images/david

Will this work for everyone?  If not, please let me know and I will send out
modifications.
