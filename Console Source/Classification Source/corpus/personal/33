
Hey!  Guess it was hard to get back, huh!  I was going to get Jake one of
those baby wipe warmers and send it with Art &amp; Jo, but Walmart was out of
them. Maybe I need to get something else.  Do you have one of those toys
that goes on the bar of the carrier?  Is Jake ok? Let me hear from you,
you &amp; Shane can have a chance to call if you want to.  I sure do miss
holding Jake and playing with Cole.  Cole is so funny.  I&apos;ve been telling
everybody things that he does &amp; they can&apos;t believe it at 2 yrs. old.  I
gotta get busy--let me know if you get this.  I know you&apos;re busy, just a
little answer to let me know &apos;cause I sent you one a while back that you
never answered and the last 2 that I sent Shane &amp; Shelly they didn&apos;t get.
Love ya, Ma
