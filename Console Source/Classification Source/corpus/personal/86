Dave,
Guess I had some misinformation on the type.  Per Yvette, the platelets or cells in Darren Farmer&apos;s blood were the match and the blood type was secondary.  I&apos;m not sure how it works, but Darren is definitely the guy.  I have a call in to Lisa to clarify this.

funny ... when I talked to Daren, he said he was A+.  Could it be Daron Giron?

Hi Dave,

Thanks for offering to talk to Darren about Lisa &amp; Christopher.  Lisa can be reached at home at 281-296-0788 or cell 713-443-4523.  I&apos;m sure she can fill in the details on how to have the blood credited to her account.

Anyone else you know of who has B- blood and would like to give would be MUCH appreciated!
