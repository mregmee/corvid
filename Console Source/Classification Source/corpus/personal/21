
Please respond to Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy&apos;s sugar levels =
are staying up pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took =
a shot last night &amp; I guess she didn&apos;t eat enough ice cream.  She was mad a=
t me cause I didn&apos;t give her more than I did.  But it&apos;s so hard to know exa=
ctly how to handle it &apos;cause she&apos;s been going to bed a little high &amp; gettin=
g up a little high.  But anyway, she&apos;s doing better &amp; I guess she&apos;ll always=
 be mad &amp; think I&apos;m mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not kno=
wing if she got low after I left &amp; passed out &amp; no one would know it.  I&apos;m =
going to try to get a cell phone &amp; have her call me when she gets there--I =
think--I don&apos;t know--she&apos;ll be mad about that too.  But the other night, sh=
e didn&apos;t eat right after she took her shot, then didn&apos;t eat anything fast a=
cting &amp; got in the truck to go over to Phillip&apos;s to get research info from =
his computer, got low &amp; had to pull over &amp; eat sugar tabs.  So that&apos;s what =
scares me.  She knew to eat righ!
t after she took that shot &amp; didn&apos;t. But she was high before she took it &amp; =
I guess she didn&apos;t think about it getting low. I don&apos;t know what will happe=
n to her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we&apos;re going to Dallas to look for=
 the prom dress &amp; shoes, don&apos;t know if we will stay all night or not. I hav=
en&apos;t talked to Shane &amp; Shelley.  I wanted to stay &amp; go to Saturn Rd. to chu=
rch &amp; go to the singles class.  But I don&apos;t know what Shane &amp; Shelley have =
planned.  So we&apos;ll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to=
 work on 3 research papers &amp; projects that are all due at once.  So, wish u=
s luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they&apos;re more than I was=
 expecting. But anyway, I don&apos;t intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will b=
e some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got =
back home Sunday. Hug them for me &amp; tell Cole that Mimi can&apos;t wait to see h=
