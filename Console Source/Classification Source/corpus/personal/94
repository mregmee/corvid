Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE&apos;s List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn&apos;t lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE&apos;s ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE&apos;s annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in &quot;Patient But Not Passive,&quot; the story that accompanies the list, &quot;By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion.&quot; 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE&apos;s inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, &quot;people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,&quot; she says.
