
there. I would assume everyone will just leave and come back to run you 
books. The jersey&apos;s will be done and I will have them for you. They cost 
$25.00, so try and bring the cash Wed. Our shirts are black with red numbers, 
everyone please try and wear black shorts so if we play like shit we&apos;ll at 
least look good.
