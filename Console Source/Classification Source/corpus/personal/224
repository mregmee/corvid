So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don&apos;t think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won&apos;t be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Let me know,
