click the &quot;Small Slideshow&quot; link. This will bring down all the photos at
once, and will cycle through all of them four times in a slideshow. Please
note that it might take some time to download all the pictures, depending
upon the speed of your connection to the Internet.

After the slideshow starts, all of the regular-sized pictures on the other
pages will temporarily be on your PC, which should make clicking through
each page a little faster.

If you run into problems viewing any of the pages/pictures, please drop me a
note.

Thanks,
