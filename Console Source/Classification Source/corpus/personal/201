
This is funny - I&apos;ve been thinking about you too!  We went to Zio&apos;s
yesterday - met Kenna there.  I had not been there since you guys.  It was
good to see her.  I had lunch with Randa the other day too - miss watching
you two communicate - ha!
What&apos;s going on with you?  You like your job?
I finally bought a Kenny Chesney CD and that song &quot;hello&quot;, I remember with
you how I did not want to like that song .... but I love it and him.  I&apos;m a
little slow to come around sometime - ha!
Are you still shopping?  How&apos;s Meghan?  I bet she&apos;s talking!!!
Update me when you can!
BYE!
Marilyn
