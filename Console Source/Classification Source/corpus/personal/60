
Michelle,

Thank you for your interest in our child care center! We do still have openings in our pre-school class at this time. If you are interested in obtaining an application, you can either pick one up from me at EB1633d or let me send one to you via intercompany mail. Let me know either way.

Regards,

Charla

I wanted to get additional information.  My daughter will be 3 this August.  Is there an opening for that class?  If not, how long is the waiting list?  Thanks.
