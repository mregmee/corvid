     Hi.  I have email access!!  My contact info...


     Feel free to forward this info to other members of the group.   I&apos;m
still in corporate housing, so no home address yet.

     The only loose end that I can think of pertains to an issue that came
up in the exit interview.  Am I to be reimbursed for unused vacation?
Norma Villereal said something about this, but I&apos;m not certain about the
details.

     Stay in touch.
