&gt; Hey, AC!
&gt;
&gt; How are things going for you?  Liking your new
&gt; freedom, wild girl?  I hope
&gt; your having fun.  I&apos;m sure missing you on Entex.
&gt; I&apos;m already feeling the
&gt; heat from TM.  With the cold spell and the change in
&gt; weather forecasts, I
&gt; have to re-evaluate Entex everyday.  But, that&apos;s the
&gt; way it always is over
&gt; here.  I&apos;ve been meaning to e-mail you, but I always
&gt; remember after I leave
&gt; the office.  Anyway, let me know how it&apos;s going.
&gt;
&gt; Later,
&gt; D
&gt;
