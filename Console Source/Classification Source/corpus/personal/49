
Louise,

Birth registry with The Vital Statistics and Records office (the office who issues certified original birth certificates) will not have record of Scott&apos;s birth for approximately eight weeks.  We need this document to obtain the UK birth registry and passport.


If you have no immediate travel plans, I have calendared the seventh week (after Scott&apos;s birth) to obtain documentation from you, a letter with your signature stating I can receive it on your behalf and a copy of your drivers license.  I will then confirm his birth has been registered and apply on your behalf.

Best Regards,
      Bobbi
