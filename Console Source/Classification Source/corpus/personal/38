
Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy&apos;s sugar levels are staying up 
pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took a shot last night 
&amp; I guess she didn&apos;t eat enough ice cream.  She was mad at me cause I didn&apos;t 
give her more than I did.  But it&apos;s so hard to know exactly how to handle it 
&apos;cause she&apos;s been going to bed a little high &amp; getting up a little high.  But 
anyway, she&apos;s doing better &amp; I guess she&apos;ll always be mad &amp; think I&apos;m 
mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low 
after I left &amp; passed out &amp; no one would know it.  I&apos;m going to try to get a 
cell phone &amp; have her call me when she gets there--I think--I don&apos;t 
know--she&apos;ll be mad about that too.  But the other night, she didn&apos;t eat 
right after she took her shot, then didn&apos;t eat anything fast acting &amp; got in 
the truck to go over to Phillip&apos;s to get research info from his computer, got 
low &amp; had to pull over &amp; eat sugar tabs.  So that&apos;s what scares me.  She knew 
to eat righ!
t after she took that shot &amp; didn&apos;t. But she was high before she took it &amp; I 
guess she didn&apos;t think about it getting low. I don&apos;t know what will happen to 
her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we&apos;re going to Dallas to look for 
the prom dress &amp; shoes, don&apos;t know if we will stay all night or not. I 
haven&apos;t talked to Shane &amp; Shelley.  I wanted to stay &amp; go to Saturn Rd. to 
church &amp; go to the singles class.  But I don&apos;t know what Shane &amp; Shelley have 
planned.  So we&apos;ll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to 
work on 3 research papers &amp; projects that are all due at once.  So, wish us 
luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they&apos;re more than I was 
expecting. But anyway, I don&apos;t intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will be 
some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got 
back home Sunday. Hug them for me &amp; tell Cole that Mimi can&apos;t wait to see his
