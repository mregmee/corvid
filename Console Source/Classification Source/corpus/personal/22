Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She&apos;s been having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have stopped waking her up to check it in the night &amp; the levels are so much better. She&apos;s acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I guess her sugars out of control &amp; all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was wrong with her.  She doesn&apos;t say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy&apos;s.  Let him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye &quot;fixed&quot;.
