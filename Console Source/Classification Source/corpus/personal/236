
Hey Bill (or do you prefer William Williams the 3rd),

What&apos;s up?  I bet you didn&apos;t think I&apos;d e-mail you.
Don&apos;t worry, I have nothing against players.  Just
kidding...

I hope you had a good time at the show last weekend.
Maktub were pretty cool.  I know they play around
Seattle frequently so I&apos;ll check them out again
sometime.  Maybe you&apos;ll luck out and they&apos;ll come to
Portland soon.  I&apos;m sure you have a decent music scene
in Portland so you always have other options.  I&apos;ve
found that you can find some really cool little bands
or musicians in the most random little bars and
restaurants.

I hope all is well in Portland at the moment.  Seattle
has been pretty sunny and warm so I can&apos;t complain.
I&apos;m totally looking forward to summer.  There will be
something to do every weekend.  Thank god.  Time to
start taking all my &quot;sick&quot; days!

Have a good day.  Don&apos;t work too hard.   If you do,
make sure you play harder to make up for it.

Talk to you later.
Colleen (the first)
