
Dear Louise,
I just got your e-mail. I am so glad to hear you&apos;re happy with the painting.
I am working on the yellow one and will let you know as soon as it&apos;s
finished. I look forward in seeing those pictures...
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a wonderful new year filled with
joy, love and success for you and your family.
Take care and keep in touch.
Happy Holidays!!
Sincerely,
Barbara.


&gt;
&gt;Barbara,
&gt;
&gt;It&apos;s Saturday night in Houston and Marcus (my husband) and I just hung your
&gt;painting in our dining room.  It looks unbelievable - we love it.  I
&gt;decided because I loved it too much to bring in home and it is now in our
&gt;home.  Thankyou so much .
&gt;
&gt;Tammie will sort our the money on Monday.
&gt;
&gt;I love it so much I had to bring it home.It is far too good for work.
&gt;
&gt;Take care and obviously our thoughts are with you at this time.  We look
&gt;forward to the yellow one and we have already decided where to put it.  I
&gt;will take so photos so you can see how prominent the red one is in our
&gt;home.
&gt;
&gt;Take care
&gt;
&gt;Louise

&gt;    Louise &amp; Tammie,
&gt;    I want to thank you for the beautiful flowers you sent me, they are
&gt;    really
&gt;    nice.
&gt;    I really appreciate all your attentions with me.
&gt;
&gt;    Tammie as we agreed last Friday i was thinking that the easiest way to
&gt;    send
&gt;    me the money for the painting is makingg a deposit on my mom&apos;s US
&gt;    account.
&gt;
&gt;    Account #027-4729060
&gt;
&gt;    one
&gt;    is almost finished and Tammie&apos;s painting it is ready! I&apos;m just waiting
&gt;    it to
&gt;    let it dry so I can send it. (those are Christmas gifts for both) Those
&gt;    are
&gt;    on me!
&gt;
&gt;    Thanks again and talk to you on Monday.
&gt;    Warm Regards,
&gt;    Barbara
