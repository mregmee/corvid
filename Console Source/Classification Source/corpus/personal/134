
Hey!  The curtains look good--I hope they do when they are hung-- Lacy &amp; I
are planning to come next Friday the 18th. when ya&apos;ll go to the rodeo.  I&apos;m
taking a personal day from the bus and leaving early. Thought I would bring
them. Answer &amp; let me know if that&apos;s ok.  If you need them before then I&apos;ll
try to get them mailed.  Hope sweet Cole is feeling better over his cold.
Love you, Mom
