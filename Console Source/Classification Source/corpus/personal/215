
Thanks for the story!  Have an all day meeting today, and my grandparents are going back to Maryland.  I did get a pair of pj&apos;s for Meaghan at Gymboree - the red ones with the little pique heart design.  Hope you did not get them too!

A man asked his wife what she&apos;d like for her birthday. 

&quot;I&apos;d love to be six again,&quot; she replied. 

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off 
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every 
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the 
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a 
McDonald&apos;s they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along 
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a 
movie - the latest Star Wars! 

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband 
and collapsed into bed. 

He leaned over and lovingly asked, &quot;Well, dear; what was it like being 
six again?&quot; 

One eye opened, &quot;You idiot, I meant my dress size.&quot;
