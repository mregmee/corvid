
Vince,

Thanks for the note - and congratulations on yours as well.  

I haven&apos;t had too much to do yet with the research guys here as they&apos;re 
pretty much self directed.  Once a week (Thursday AM) I&apos;ve started a joint 
project update meeting with Structuring and Research.  I hope this way the 
Structuring team can bounce quantitative issues off Research and the Research 
guys can stay closer to the commercial deals.

Congratulations. Well deserved. I am very happy your tremendous
contribution to the company has been recognized.
