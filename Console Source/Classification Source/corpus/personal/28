
Hey! I&apos;v almost got the curtains finished.  Been so busy, everything&apos;s so
busy this week.  I probably won&apos;t get them mailed until Mon.&apos;cause I have to
borrow a car from someone at work in order to get to the Post Office in time
before it closes in this hick town, &amp; everyone goes home early &amp; don&apos;t want
to wait around on Fri.  But I&apos;ll get them there asap.  They won&apos;t have
buttons, &apos;cause Tonya didn&apos;t know what kind she wanted when we got the
material. We&apos;ll be at competition all day Sat. at Plano &amp; then at Shane&apos;s
Sat. night. Home Sun. sometime.  Wish ya&apos;ll could be with us.  Lacy is in 3
different routines--she made all of them.On front row.Maybe I can see her
ok.  Gotta go. Let me know if you get this. My comp. is kinda messed up.
Give Cole a hug. Love, Ma
