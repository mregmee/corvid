I thought I&apos;d drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to

Anyhow I&apos;m Nikki.  I&apos;d go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I
can&apos;t wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say &quot;hi&quot;.  I&apos;m really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know
people.

I don&apos;t know what Brendan has told you about me but here&apos;s the story.  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.
Where there&apos;s not dirt there&apos;s piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree.

So, to say the least I&apos;m a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I&apos;m moving to Oregon.  I&apos;ve never
visited or anything I&apos;m just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it&apos;s
because of the two movies &quot;Goonies&quot; and &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;.  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now&apos;s my
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my master&apos;s in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We&apos;ll see
which fits me best later.  I don&apos;t feel that at 24 I can really decide the
&quot;best&quot; avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I&apos;m waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later.

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.
I&apos;m a very spontaneous type of person I don&apos;t really &quot;do&quot; planning and
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It&apos;s better
that way.  Life can be too organized!

Well now that I&apos;ve given you a &quot;short&quot; introduction...haha.  I&apos;d love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.
Don&apos;t worry if they change I won&apos;t hold ya to them.  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don&apos;t go
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I&apos;m planning as many trips as I possibly can.
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible

Hope to hear from you soon!
Nikki
