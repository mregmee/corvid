
Good morning,

I&apos;d love to go get some coffee with you, but remember that annoying project that Mike Etringer wants me to work on for him? This morning I am kinda under some pressure to hurry up and try to get some stuff figured out so I really don&apos;t have much spare time right now. JA would flip out if I left for coffee now. Maybe later this afternoon? Or tomorrow morning? Anyhow, another ride sounds really cool. I had lots of fun. And yes, it would be cooler if I didn&apos;t have to worry about work. Let me know when you have extra time to go for a ride.
My weekend was pretty fun. I weed-wacked (is that a word?) my yard for the first time. It looks so bad. I so don&apos;t know anything about lawn care. Also I planted some herbs and stuff in my yard which I am sure my dog will destroy, but it s worth a try. Oh yeah, I also bought a snowboard. It&apos;s pretty cool. I bought some step-in switch boots, too. Cool, eh?
