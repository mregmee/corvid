
Wish you were here!  Can&apos;t believe you got away so fast!
How&apos;s your job - is it you?
How&apos;s Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli&apos;s party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you&apos;re doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda&apos;s wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn&apos;t get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always &quot;up&quot; - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
Marilyn
