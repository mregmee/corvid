
Hey!  Good to hear from you.  Yes, it is sad about Randa but we are all
thinking about her and praying for her.  I hope she found a job by now - I
think she was laid off during 1Q lay offs!  Her husband is still working
her, so that is good at least one of them still has a job at least.

Meghan - I forgot her name already!  I bet she is a cutie.  I just saw my
niece in Colorado Springs - it was her 3rd birthday this past Sunday so I
got to celebrate it with her.  We had a party for her and I don&apos;t think I
saw so many 2 and 3 year olds in my life!  They kept wanting to eat
something - anything.   Are kids always that hungry?  It was hilarious.  I
can&apos;t believe she is talking in complete sentences either.  I&apos;m shocked at
how time really flies by.  Yes, it seems just like yesterday she was born.
I think that is neat that Kellyn (my niece) and Meghan are close in age.
I&apos;ll have to be sure to remember that!

No huge vacations for us..my husband and I bought a house in Magnolia May
2000 - 1 month before I got laid off - so all our money has been going into
the house for the past year.  I bet you didn&apos;t know about it because I don&apos;t
think they gave me a chance to say goodbye to anyone when they let us go.
I&apos;m wondering, did you even know I got laid off?  I can&apos;t remember anymore.
Its been such a long time.  Besides the Colorado trip I just took, we are
going to Connecticut next week for my husband&apos;s family reunion, so it will
be nice to be in cool weather again.  How about you guys?  Are you still the
jetsetters of Houston?

I know we probably won&apos;t see each other but Marilyn and I talk about you
once in a while and how much fun and interesting you were.  If ever you are
in the neighborhood, please give us a call and we would love to see you,
okay?  Take care.

Hi,
I am doing terrific!  I would have written sooner, but I just got back
from a business trip.

I do miss the old lunch gang...how are things going?  Which group are
you guys in now?  Randa told me she had received a severance package and
is currently looking for a job.  Sounds like a lot of people have
left...

Thanks for asking about Meghan (that&apos;s so sweet).  Can you believe she
is about to turn 3 in a couple of weeks?!?!  How&apos;s your niece, the one
that is the same age?  Doesn&apos;t it seem like just yesterday that she was
born?

Have you guys been on more terrific vacations?  Email me details...talk
soon!

Remember me?  Marilyn Rice and I were talking about our old group and
your
name came up.  We are both wondering how you are so I decided to shoot
you
an email.  We would love to hear how you are and how you little girl is
doing, etc.

We miss seeing you!  Take care - ps
