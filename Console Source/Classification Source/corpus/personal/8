thing--that would be fun for me....I still think somethign like a limo is in
order.  It may not be our personalities but I think Mother likes a big
to-do.

trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don&apos;t think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I&apos;ll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

called Josephine&apos;s house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some Enron doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.

&gt; Cara,
&gt;
&gt; Just talked to Sally.  I think a very nice dinner in Austin sounds great.
&gt; I
&gt; also think going somewhere for Thanksgiving sounds fun--and a lot more
&gt; feasible for me financially.  (We $tart the orthodontia today....)  I will
&gt; look at restaurants in the next couple of days and send you two some
&gt; options.  It would be nice to find someplace very, very nice that Mom and
&gt; Dad haven&apos;t been to before.  Also think we should have them picked up in a
&gt; limo....
&gt;
&gt; Whew.....

&gt; Hello, Sista -
&gt;
&gt; Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well)
&gt; -
&gt;
&gt; Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
&gt; about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
&gt; THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at
&gt; that
&gt; time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks
&gt; maybe
&gt; we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving
&gt; travel
&gt; MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
&gt; help you.
&gt;
&gt; Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
&gt; Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom
&gt; and
&gt; dad would like that.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts?   -Cara
