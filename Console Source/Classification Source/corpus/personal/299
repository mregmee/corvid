Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY &amp; hope all is well.  As you may recall from the ROG real
options conference in NY, I&apos;d indicated the opportunity to visit with you
next time I&apos;m in Houston.  I&apos;ll be there during 4/18-4/21 &amp; wonder if we can
pls meet on Wed. 4/19 in your offices.  Would appreciate it if you can pls
let me know whether you&apos;re available then (I&apos;m flexible on the schedule
particulars).  If not, pls let me know whether 4/18 (afternoon), 4/20
(afternoon), or 4/21 (morning) will work for you.

I really look forward to the opportunity &amp; would appreciate to learn more
about how you&apos;ve instigated the real options thinking in Enron and
especially its integration within the organizational &amp; incentive matters.

Many thanks,
