
Remember Me?  I&apos;m the one who loved you so much that I gave my very best at
raising you. And now I&apos;m missing you so much. Lacy &amp; I can&apos;t  understand why
you don&apos;t call to check on us &amp; just to talk a while--it doesn&apos;t count that
Tonya calls--I didn&apos;t raise her.We want to hear your voice every once in a
while.  I know you work a lot, but you used to find time once a week.And
that&apos;s no excuse. You can schedule in a call to us.  We&apos;re still your family
too.  We love you, Ma
