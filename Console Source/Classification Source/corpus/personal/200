
It&apos;s not the same without your smiling face!!!!!!

I hope all is well for you and your family....how is that precious daughter
of yours?  I bet Meghan is really growing!!  (sorry, I probably mispelled
her name)

We miss you very much but so glad you found a new &quot;home&quot;.....(ie work place)

I wanted to drop a line and say hello.....

I&apos;m enjoying working at campus.  It&apos;s very nice being close to home and my
son&apos;s school.

Take care,
