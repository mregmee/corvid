Now what? I see Ken is back and Jeff is  out. What a development. Jeff has a lot of his bud&apos;s in high places. Could be  many changes on the horizon.
 
How you doing? Moved to new building yet?  I&apos;ll be looking for my tour invitation.
 
How&apos;s the kids, wife, and home (read that  work project)?
 
Jen is home for a couple of weeks before  heading back to Waco. We are going up there to tour the new Law school (built  with tobacco settlement money -- so we feel like contributators). She has four  quarters down and 5 maybe 6 to go.
 
Son still in Florida. We plan to run over  there in September for a few days. Maybe do Disneyworld.
 
Jeni is supposed to get us tickets to the  Nebraska game in Waco this year. That should be fun. Speaking of football, I see  one Texas team high in the polls. The other???????
 
I got a new toy the other day. Sears had  a good sale on a power washer I&apos;ve had my eye on, so I bought it. Just did the  patio and deck. God, I thought painting was mindless  work.....................
Also, found out from insurance company  they will be funding an entirely new roof (hail damage???). I don&apos;t like the  mess from that project but as old roof was a layover the old shake shingles I  will be glad to get rid of that and get decking down on roof.   
 
Know you are busy. Let me know the latest  when you have time.
 
Later,
