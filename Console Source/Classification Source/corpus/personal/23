
Hey--Just thought I&apos;d let you know that Lacy went to school this morning-pale &amp; not feeling well--stomach still hurts, but she went ahead.  She&apos;s stressing me out big time.  She acted like she couldn&apos;t hardly move, but I came back in the house &amp; she was talking fine on the telephone.  But I ask her questions about how she feels &amp; she is just about dead.  I don&apos;t know about her.  But she looked pale.  Blood sugar was a little low this morning.  I woke her up at 2 &amp; had her check it &amp; it was good. So I got a little more rest.  I don&apos;t think she even woke up enough to remember it.  I don&apos;t think the little job is good for her if she&apos;s gonna catch everything they have.  She&apos;s so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids &amp; then bites her nails.  Not good!  Anyway, I&apos;m stressed big time over her &amp; over her driving the car. And missing so much school.  I wasn&apos;t going to take her to the dr. yesterday because she was better so I figured it was a virus, b!
ut she had to have a note from a doctor or she&apos;s gonna have to make up school on Saturday &amp; they&apos;ve threatened to fine me. So I had to pay $30 for them to tell me that she had a virus &amp; missed a day of work.  Oh, well, life is fun.  Anyway, I need to quit gettin down over such trivial things cause there&apos;s so many with worse problems to face. I am thankful that the burdens are so light.  But you can still pray for us.  And encourage Lacy to work at Splash Town! Ha!
