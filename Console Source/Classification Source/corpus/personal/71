
My depo just got canned. I&apos;ll e-mail again when I&apos;m coming down there and
hopefully grab lunch. Come visit your brother some weekend when Miller&apos;s
band is playing. Your children need to see your ancestral roots.

I have a depo on Weds. in the lovely Bayou City. Are you available for
lunch? I&apos;ll call Yardbird and Jones.
