&gt; &gt; Breast Cancer 
&gt; &gt; ============= 
&gt; &gt; I&apos;m forwarding this to everyone I know because it makes so much 
&gt; &gt; sense. Please forward it to everyone you care about and even those you 
&gt; &gt; don&apos;t. 
&gt; &gt; Ladies, be aware! Gentlemen, pass this on to the ladies in your 
&gt; &gt; life! 
&gt; &gt; Sometime ago, I attended a Breast-Cancer-Awareness seminar organized by 
&gt; &gt; Terry Birk with support from Dan Sullivan. During the Q&amp;A period,I asked 
&gt; why 
&gt; &gt; the most common area for breast cancer was near the arm pit. My question 
&gt; &gt; could not be answered at that time. This e-mail was just sent to me, and 
I 
&gt; &gt; find it very interesting that my question has been answered. I challenge 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; all to re-think your daily use of a product that could ultimately lead 
to 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; terminal illness. As of today, I will change my use. A friend forwarded 
&gt; this 
&gt; &gt; to me. I showed it to a friend going through chemotherapy and she said 
she 
&gt; &gt; learned this fact in a support group recently. I wish I had known it 14 
&gt; &gt; years 
&gt; &gt; ago. I just got information from a health seminar that I would like to 
&gt; &gt; share. The leading cause of breast cancer is the use of anti-perspirant. 
&gt; &gt; What? A Concentration of toxins leads to cell mutations, a.k.a. CANCER. 
&gt; Yes, 
&gt; &gt; ANTI-PERSPIRANT. Most of the products out there are an 
&gt; &gt; anti-perspirant/deodorant combination, so go home and check. Deodorant 
is 
&gt; &gt; fine, anti-perspirant is not. 
&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s why. The human body has a few areas that it uses to purge 
&gt; &gt; toxins from the body -- behind the knees, behind the ears, the groin 
area, 
&gt; &gt; and armpits. The toxins are purged in the form of perspiration. 
&gt; &gt; Anti-perspirant, as the name clearly indicates, prevents you from 
&gt; &gt; perspiring, thereby inhibiting the body from purging toxins from below 
the 
&gt; &gt; armpits. These toxins do not just magically disappear. Instead, the body 
&gt; &gt; deposits them in the lymph nodes below the arms since it cannot sweat 
them 
&gt; &gt; out. Nearly all breast cancer tumors occur in the upper outside quadrant 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; the breast area. This is precisely where the lymph 
&gt; &gt; nodes are located. Additionally, men are less likely (but not completely 
&gt; &gt; exempt) to develop breast cancer prompted by anti-perspirant usage 
because 
&gt; &gt; most of the anti-perspirant product is caught in their hair and is not 
&gt; &gt; directly applied to the skin. Women who apply anti-perspirant right 
after 
&gt; &gt; shaving increase 
&gt; &gt; the risk further because shaving causes almost imperceptible nicks in 
the 
&gt; &gt; skin which give the chemicals entrance into the body from the armpit 
area. 
&gt; &gt; PLEASE pass this along to anyone you care about. Breast cancer is 
becoming 
&gt; &gt; frighteningly common. This awareness may save lives. If you are 
skeptical 
&gt; &gt; about these findings, I urge you to do some research for yourself. You 
&gt; might 
&gt; &gt; just arrive at the same conclusions. Thank you.
