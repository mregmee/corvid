
The message below was sent Friday afternoon and came back with an incorrect 
address. Merry gave me the corrected e-mail address shown above.

New developments. Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now 
been named. He is Brandon Aaron Byington

Hi there, Darren &amp; Tonya,

still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, I&apos;m just calling him &quot;New 
Child&quot; Byington.

He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4&quot; long. Merry, Doc, and &quot;New Child&quot; are 
doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (C section) so he says 
he was a bit shakey there a time or two.

Here are some digital camera pics I took when &quot;N. C.&quot; was less thasn an hour 
old.
