I am tentatively planning on being in The Woodlands Wednesday.  Should I
stop by the house that night or do we need to get together tomorrow or
Wednesday morning?

&gt; Hello, Vince.
&gt;
&gt; I guess you are still traveling a lot.  I just wanted to say hello and see
&gt; when we can get together and look at getting some more money deposited
&gt; into
&gt; the CMA for future investments.
&gt;
&gt; Get back with me when you can.
