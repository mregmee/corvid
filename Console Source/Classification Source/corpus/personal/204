to watch a movie.  They would watch a few minutes at a time of Barney.

Yes, let&apos;s allget together soon...call me!

was a good tear jerker, Charlie&apos;s Angel was humorous because we weren&apos;t
expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would
recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD&apos;s and her two favorite that she
watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls
seen either one?









Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven&apos;t
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I&apos;ve seen &quot;Perfect
Storm&quot; and &quot;The Patriot&quot; .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.
