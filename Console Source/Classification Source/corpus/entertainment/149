
This is Cara&apos;s assistant, Cara White.   Cara asked me to send you her

Cara will be in New York for a week.

Thursday through Saturday, she will stay at the Edison Hotel (212) 840-5000

Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn&apos;t know
the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don&apos;t have
time to look it up.)

Also, until Sunday, you may try her husband&apos;s cell phone (512) 657-1555

You can always try Cara&apos;s cell phone (512) 970-0608 - but she hasn&apos;t really
figured out how to retrieve messages yet - so you&apos;ll probably have better
luck leaving a message at the hotel.

Cara will return on Thursday evening on American Flight #1669, arriving at
