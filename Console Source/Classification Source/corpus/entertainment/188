Folks,

You&apos;ve probably already read that listbot is dying as of August 6.

So, I&apos;ve created a transition list on another service. To send messages to


Friday, August 13.

If you are still interested in participating in the &quot;Bammel Young Families&quot;

If you think you&apos;ll want to check the past messages, or to create your own


2. On the right hand side of the page, type in your e-mail address under
&quot;Not a Topica Member yet&quot;

3. Click &quot;Continue&quot;

4. Fill in the registration, then click the &quot;I agree&quot; button

5. You&apos;ll next see a page with text like &quot;Thanks, Ram! You&apos;re almost done.&quot;

6. Scroll to the end of this page, and click the &quot;continue&quot; button.

7. A dialog will pop-up, asking whether you want to &quot;tap into exclusive...
blah, blah, blah&quot;. Just click Cancel.

Once you join the new list, please drop me an e-mail to
won&apos;t get duplicate messages from both lists.



One nice feature of topica is the ability to put messages on &quot;Vacation
Hold&quot;, so that we don&apos;t end up with auto-responder problems. For more info
&quot;vacation hold&quot; link under &quot;subscriber services&quot;.


Thanks,
