This just in Ags!  If you are going to the OSU game on Sept 22, a Red, White 
&amp; Blue Out is being planned, just like the Maroon Out games for the OSU 
game. 
Ags, What better statement can we Aggies make, than to celebrate the love 
and support for our country&apos;s freedom, and our patriotic nature, than this 
Imagine...The Fightin&apos; Texas Aggie Band playing &quot;The Star Spangled Banner,&quot; 
playing military drills as they walk around the stadium, and we celebrate 
our love for our country, and our support for all the heroes, alive and 
Pass the word on.... we have 1 1/2 weeks!! 
The Spirit of America, and the Aggie Spirit is still alive.  God Bless 
America, the Free Nation.
