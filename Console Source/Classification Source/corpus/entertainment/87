
Vince -
I couldn&apos;t have been more pleased than when I saw your name on the Managing 
Director promotion list last January - who says nice guys finish last!  

I&apos;ve had the announcement in my &quot;to do&quot; folder all this time, waiting for me 
to catch up enough to send you this message, but I guess you&apos;re no stranger 
to that scenario....

Nothing stochastic about it, you&apos;re simply the best!
