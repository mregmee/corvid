&gt; Happy new year!  I hope that you and your family had a great holiday
&gt; season.
&gt;
&gt; My notes of our meeting on the 21st show that you wanted us to interview
&gt; Gerstandt, McDonald (if possible), Sharp, and Kaiser.  Please let me know
&gt; at your convenience when you&apos;d like for us to meet with them.  I&apos;m
&gt; available to do it pretty much anytime this week.  Thanks.
