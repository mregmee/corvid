
Dear Daren Farmer,

One of the things we like to do here at Expedia is help you
maximize your vacation dollar. Since accommodations are a
big part of every vacation, we went to more than 1,200 quality
hotels in more than 240 cities and negotiated hotel rates up to
70% less than the average standard rates. We call these Expedia
Special Rates, and it&apos;s all about saving you money. When you
search for a hotel on Expedia.com, just look for the &quot;Expedia
Special Rates&quot; icon and you&apos;ll know you&apos;re getting this special rate.

Right now, you can take advantage of an Expedia Special Rate
at the brand-new Aladdin Resort in Las Vegas. This spectacular
hotel just opened, and it features one of the largest collections of
shopping, dining, entertainment, and gaming options available in
