Instead of going to the haunted house, we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved.  The weather is going to nice and cool, so the
plan is to have a fire, eat and then play &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;.  We will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side. The goal of the game is to find  your team&apos;s flag
and bring it safely back to your side.  Of course, it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky, because if you get caught on your opponent&apos;s side, then
you have to wait until you are freed.  It is a very fun game, but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people&apos;s personalities.  If
you aren&apos;t up to playing the game, then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours.
