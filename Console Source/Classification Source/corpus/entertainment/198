Here is this week&apos;s material.? There&apos;s  probably way too much stuff to use it 
all, so I wouldn&apos;t even try.? Pick  out the things and questions that you 
feel are the most important and will hit  your group the best.? Just remember 
that this material is only one part of  what needs to be happening in your 
NEON group.? The getting to know and  share with each other is critical--use 
one of the icebreaker  activities you have (even if it seems cheesy) or 
somehow ask questions and get  the group talking with each other or about 
themselves.

See the note above the material about the CD in  your NEON box.

Finally, I haven&apos;t let you know about the new  leaders we have working with 
us, specifically with Carol Poe and the Backors in  NEON Silver--Leslie and 
Debbie Bills!? Welcome Debbie and Les!
?
Keep up the great work!
