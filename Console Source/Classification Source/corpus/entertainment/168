
The February NCL Regular Meeting will be this coming
Creek Community Center.  We will be collecting items
to donate to Northwest Assistance Ministries, which
has suffered a serious cutback in funding. They are
particularly in need of personal care items such as
toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, hair care items, etc.
