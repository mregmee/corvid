
Shan,

It&apos;s nice to hear from you. Congratulations on the new job.
FT is my favorite publication I never miss (and I read a number
of different FT publications, including FT Energy collection).

You can contact Harry Arora (X 6750)  here in London who works on
finance related E-commerce projects. He may give you some useful
comments. I shall be myself very interested in the first issue
of your new publication.

Regards

I hope you&apos;re very well.  As you can see, I am now working for the FT&apos;s
magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what&apos;s currently 
termed
the Expatriate Division and I&apos;ve just passed my statutory probationary period
of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew
you&apos;d hear from me sooner or later , especially when I need help! Having 
gotten
thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects......I&apos;m investigating 
several
ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
one of them.

Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international
private investor, specifically
o HNWIs
o Owner-managers
o Results-oriented but intelligent investor with long-term investment goals 
and
a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on
something approaching equal terms

The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including
the &quot;wilder shores&quot; such as Hedge Funds and Emerging Markets. I am working on 
a
portal site (imaginatively entitled FTEXPAT.COM!), nested within FT.com, which
will launch in October; International Investment will be a significant channel
on the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future)
offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion
of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other
contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know 
it&apos;s
not bang in your sphere but I&apos;m hoping you&apos;ll be interested enough to share
your thoughts with me.

If you can give me a few pointers, I&apos;d be grateful. Looking forward to hearing
from you,

Sh?n
