ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

Fan Fares gives you the chance to spend some time in a city you might not 
otherwise visit. This weekend, enjoy yourself in Milwaukee.

TRAVEL TO MILWAUKEE

A friendly city with a decidedly sophisticated air, this midwestern gem 
offers plenty of art and cultural events, nightlife, and beautiful lakeside 
parks. And there&apos;s plenty to do indoors in Milwaukee, so don&apos;t let the 
February weather keep you away.

In addition to the professional basketball action on Saturday night (Indiana 
comes to town to play Milwaukee), here&apos;s a few other ideas to get your 
planning started.

THE HAGGERTY MUSEUM OF ART
Located on the western end of downtown on the Marquette University campus, 
the museum&apos;s collection includes works by Dali, Chagall and Man Ray. You&apos;ll 
also find an impressive collection of sculpture and contemporary glass.

THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM
This museum of human and natural history is one of the nation&apos;s best and 
often sets the standard for similar institutions. Everyone in the family will 
enjoy the engaging exhibits. You&apos;ll find 150,000 square feet of exhibit 
space, through which you&apos;ll be able to visit all of the world&apos;s continents. 
Find the museum and The Humphrey IMAX Dome Theater at 800 West Wells Street.
