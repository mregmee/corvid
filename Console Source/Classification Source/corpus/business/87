
Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I&apos;ll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I&apos;ll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

&gt; I have attached BPA Transmission Schedulings&apos; response to the questions
&gt; posed by Bob in his email dated May 21 below.  If the group feels it would
&gt; be helpful to meet to discuss the timeline issues, I am in support of that
&gt; effort.  Otherwise, I look forward to the responses from the rest of the
&gt; group.  Thanks, Sue.

&gt; &gt; Yes, that&apos;s right, you did raise your hand for this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We are to submit to ISAS any recommendation(s) by August ??, 2001 (what
&gt; &gt; was the date, I didn&apos;t write it down).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there benefit to have a face-to-face meeting?  Either way, we&apos;ll use
&gt; &gt; e-mail for discussion and maybe a conference call or two.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *	A3A1-Interim is what we are currently running with.
&gt; &gt; *	A3A1-version3-draft2 goes before the NERC BOT June 10-11.
&gt; &gt; *	A3A1-candr contains public comments and responses from NERC IS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a3a1candr.doc&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; *	Are our current timelines as good as it gets?
&gt; &gt; *	Do we want to adopt the Eastern Interconnection&apos;s timelines?
&gt; &gt; *	What are the deficiencies of our timelines?
&gt; &gt; *	Will these deficiencies be present under 1.7?
&gt; &gt; *	Which timing requirements could be changed with an reasonable amount
&gt; &gt; of effort (i.e., tariff items, AGC ramp times, A3A1, etc.)?
&gt; &gt;
