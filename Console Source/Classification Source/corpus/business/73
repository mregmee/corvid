the best.
Thanks, John

&apos;Smith, Chris&apos;; &apos;Tilghman, Carmine&apos;; &apos;Underwood, John&apos;; &apos;Williams,


Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I&apos;ll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I&apos;ll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.
