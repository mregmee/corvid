We have spoken to Alice Gruber, the immigration attorney.  In order for her
to determine if we can get this L-1 transferred, she will need a very basic
diagram of the transactions between these companies.  For example, who
acquired what and at what percentage as well as whether the transactions
were stock based, asset acquisition and/or mergers.

Please send directly to me and I&apos;ll work with Alice.

acquisition of Rudolf Wolf.  We have received the following note from

&quot;Need your help sorting Paul out.  Rudolf Wolf is an MG owned company.
Paul is a UK national, on an L-1 visa obtained by the Rudolf Wolf company.
He is transitioning shortly to an Enron contract, and I&apos;m not sure what we
need to do from an immigration perspective to transition the L-1 visa.

Could you let me know what information the lawyers will need, so that I can
get the ball rolling.&quot;

Please let me know whether it is possible to bring Paul Fingster over on an
L1 given the fact that Enron did not do a stock transfer?

Many thanks

Sorry, I have been out on vacation.  Before I call Ingrid, I just wanted to
see if you found out anything on your trip to NY.  MG MCC should have
immigration attorneys who assist with their visa filings and should be able
to coach her.  I am nervous about coaching her as we have a law firm handle
all our visa issues.  Because each case may be different, we have the law
firm speak with each individual to determine the best route to take, then
they complete all the paperwork and we sign.

Hi, Jane!

I talked to Ingrid Krinke again today.  Ingrid is the HR person at MG MCC,
the New York branch of MG plc.  MG plc has acquired Rudolph Wolff, another
British company.  Rudolph wolfe has the two H1 and one L1 visa employees.
It turns out that MG plc is doing an asset acquisition of Rudolph Wolff,
not a stock transfer, and Ingrid&apos;s immigration attorney tells her that they
cannot transfer an L1 in an asset transfer.  Ingrid is starting the process
of transferring the H1&apos;s from RW to MG.  I do not know how much ingrid
knows about visas, and it would probably be good if we guided her so that
she does not so something that impacts us or that is unnecessary.

Ingrid has a thick file of immigration &quot;stuff&quot; on these folks but she does
not know what to send to us.  Could you give her a call and talk to her
about the situation?  I am concerned that i am not asking her the right
questions, or I may garble the info when I pass it on to you.  Ingrid is at
212.715.5241.  I told her that you might call.

closing is forecast for Sept. 8; i may be in NY either this monday or the
following monday collecting data.  I would be happy to sit with you and
tell you what I know , or join in on the call to ingrid.  Please ring me.
713.345.7801

Thanks a bunch.
