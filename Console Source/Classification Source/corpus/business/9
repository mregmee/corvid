Further to our conversation last week, I have managed to get some information that I hope will be useful for Louise, although I am still unclear about the exact circumstances/issues.

1)There should not be a problem with Louise&apos;s 2000 return in terms of her name. Nettleton was listed on the return and Kitchen was listed on the estimated payment vouchers. As long as the social security numbers are the same, it is unlikely that there will be any issue with the IRS but if they do come back to Lousie asking for clarification, PwC will write them a letter explaining the situation and that will be it.



Chuck - if any of the above is incorrect of if you wish to add anything, please do so asap so that David can get back with Louise.

Regards
