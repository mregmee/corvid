Sunjay understands that we are trying to identify a portfolio of candidates that represent a balance.  As such, he will continue to target other employees to further represent commercial support and specialized technical.

Please delete individuals as appropriate from attached presentation and forward back to Sunjay, with myself cc&apos;d.

Hi Jean.
I just spoke with Robert, and apparently there were some people in this version of the presentation that were not supposed to be there.
I apologize.  I&apos;m not sure how they re-appeared.
I want to make sure that this version is correct before i print 3 more copies.
So far, I have removed the following...

Coleen Sullivan-Shaklovitz
Mary Garcia
Connie Estrems
Shelly Corman
Tracy Geaconne
Jesus Melendrez
Benjamin Asante

Could you look it over, and let me know if it&apos;s correct, or if anyone else needs to be deleted (or added)?
Thanks,

Sunjay
