
Good Afternoon Louise!

I am looking forward to our interview tomorrow at 1 PM for the next ENSIDE.  I will bring a tape recorder and plan to finish in 30 minutes.  I have attached some of the possible topics to cover.  Of course, we can talk about anything else that you would like to include!

Please call me if you have any questions.
