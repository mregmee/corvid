Per Dave&apos;s note below - sounds like he want to insure the managers are 
staying on top of this and wants proof.  Please keep working with the 
managers and push this through.  Any that you have now, please forward to me 
so I can update the status report and forward to Dave.

Thanks

Shelia, to ensure we are all on the same page, I am looking for a copy of the 
review plus a written plan to rectify performance or counsel out from each 
supervisor.

Attached is a report reflecting the status of ENA Manager/Director level 
employees who were rated either Needs Improvement or Issues at the mid-year 
process.

We will update this report on a weekly basis.
