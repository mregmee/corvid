
Dear Dale/all,

Thanks for the interest... I have already contacted intranet development 
about updates - they don&apos;t have to do much except publish the document and 
maybe add some headings, so IT resources are not really a problem.  As you 
suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of 
well-explained introductions to various topics like value-at-risk, credit 
risk and so on.  It should not be at too high a level and will probably have 
to be written specifically for this purpose.  If you have time to put any 
interesting material together (Word docs, text files or Power point 
presentations), please do pass it on to me and I will collate for the update.

Anjam,

This would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site 
and expand the coverage into new areas.  Can you arrange some IT resources 
for us?  If everyone in Research works on developing the content, we just 
need IT to publish it out to the intranet.

Thoughts??
