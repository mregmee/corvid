&gt; Harvey Morris Esq.
&gt; California Public Utilities Commission
&gt; 505 Public Utilities Commission
&gt; San Francisco, California   94102
&gt;
&gt; (&quot;EPMI&quot;), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron Energy Services
&gt; Inc. (collectively referred to as &quot;EES&quot;), Enron Energy Marketing
&gt; Corporation (&quot;EEMC&quot;), and Portland General Electric Corporation (&quot;Portland
&gt; General&quot;)(collectively sometimes referred to as the &quot;Enron Entities&quot;)
&gt;
&gt; Harvey,
&gt;
&gt;  Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities&apos;
&gt; production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued
&gt; by the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter &quot;the
&gt; Commission&quot;).  The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in
&gt; undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric
&gt; markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We
&gt; believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to
&gt; commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
&gt; litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
&gt; which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
&gt; pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email
&gt; exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission
&gt; agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents,
&gt; the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these
&gt; subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections,
&gt; jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically
&gt; reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.   For all of these
&gt; proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the
&gt; attorney client and attorney work product privileges.
&gt;
&gt;  Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
&gt; for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
&gt; be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
&gt; duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
&gt; As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
&gt; production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
&gt; Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
&gt; wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
&gt; offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron
&gt; Energy Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do
&gt; not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.
&gt;
&gt; GENERAL DOCUMENTS
&gt; Requests 1 through 4
&gt;
&gt;  Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities&apos; businesses, the
&gt; burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
&gt; organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998
&gt; is significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with
&gt; exemplars of their current organizational charts, telephone directories
&gt; and so called &quot;family trees&quot; to show its current organization.  To the
&gt; extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars
&gt; of significant organizational charts, telephone directories or so called
&gt; &quot;family trees&quot; for earlier periods they will also make those available.
&gt; One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate
&gt; history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.
&gt; With respect to the other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate
&gt; histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate producing
&gt; these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.
&gt;
&gt; Requests 5 and 6
&gt;
&gt;  The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
&gt; identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
&gt; Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
&gt; information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
&gt; staff&apos;s purposes.
&gt;
&gt; FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
&gt; Requests 7 through 11
&gt;
&gt;  The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
&gt; requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
&gt; will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
&gt; &quot;Transaction Documents&quot;) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered
&gt; which information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public
&gt; filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic
&gt; Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.
&gt;
&gt; GENERATING DOCUMENTS
&gt; Requests 12, 14 and 18
&gt;
&gt;  For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
&gt; facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
&gt; probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
&gt; they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or
&gt; resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain
&gt; to each generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than
&gt; Portland General, do have documents and information for Las Vegas
&gt; Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
&gt; document productions.
&gt;
&gt;   For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
&gt; would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
&gt; twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
&gt; Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about
&gt; one half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
&gt; effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
&gt; California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless,
&gt; Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction
&gt; Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other
&gt; Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.  We propose
&gt; that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until
&gt; it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant
&gt; proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that time a
&gt; more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will
&gt; be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the
&gt; California wholesale market.
&gt;
&gt; TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
&gt; Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19
&gt;
&gt;  We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
&gt; the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and
&gt; PX.  EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
&gt; transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California
&gt; and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the
&gt; date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it
&gt; is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
&gt; information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
&gt; inaccurate.  For those
&gt; transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
&gt; understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
&gt; not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide
&gt; quickly.  The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to
&gt; EPMI&apos;s customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
&gt; business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
&gt; wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
&gt; retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
&gt; customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES&apos;
&gt; confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing
&gt; the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.
&gt;
&gt; FERC DOCUMENTS
&gt;
&gt; Request 20
&gt;
&gt;  The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
&gt; from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
&gt; those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October
&gt; 13, 2000.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
&gt; Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
&gt; Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
&gt; make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
&gt; production by then.
&gt;
&gt;  We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
&gt; any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one
&gt; currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions
&gt; will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition,
&gt; if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the
&gt; Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests
&gt; for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities
&gt; reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with
&gt; such order.
&gt;
&gt;  We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
&gt; if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
&gt; comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
&gt; or myself.
