
Sally,

I wanted you to know that I responded to this e-mail and I will also talk

Transmission.  We have now agreed that we should MTM all of Transmission and 
not &quot;cherry pick,&quot; and now it&apos;s how to handle the mechanics.

Talk with you soon,
Todd

Tim accepted the position and I informed Sally, but obviously did not give 
you the update.

When I return, tentatively May 15, I would like to get a copy of the resumes 
which you have and will post the position again.  Thank you for holding 
things together and after Tim has 2-3 weeks with Michael, he should be able 
to move to Structuring.

Pencil in lunch for that Tuesday or Wednesday that I return,
Todd
