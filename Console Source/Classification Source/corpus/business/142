
Dave,

Kevin McConville was deposed yesterday in Houston.  His rough transcript is
attached.

The deposition questioner jumped around and never went through the whole story
front to back, so you may not find this that helpful.  However, there is a
passage near the end where Kevin talks directly about Schultes&apos; getting fired.
 You should be able to find this quickly by doing a word search on Schultes.
