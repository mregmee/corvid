
AIG has agreed to buy the put at financial close which will occur in the 3rd qtr.. I should say that the current origination is $1.9mm. By the way, our first CP,FERC approval, has already occured 1month earlier than expected.

Why is Alamac put only realized next quarter




Attached is a summary of origination income YTD. It does not include the value of the Alamac put ($1.9mm) which will be realized in the third Qtr. or the $5.5mm for the ECP sale which was booked in Q1. As I mentioned this AM, I believe a conservative analysis of our current pipeline puts us at about $145mm for the year.
