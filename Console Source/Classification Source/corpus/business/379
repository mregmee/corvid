
Joel has been negotiating with Open Text along with Ryan Orsak - as Enron has 
been providing numerous resource hours testing their &apos;beta&apos; product that 
integrates Livelink with IRIMs for records management processes.  Our 
experience has been that we are finding way too many problems and that the 
product does not function as &apos;advertised&apos;.  Therefore, Joel sought a credit 
to reimburse Enron for the value of the testing we have performed for them.  
The $30,000 software credit will likely be used to purchase the web front end 
to the Livelink product.

Congratulations, Joel!

Mary, I am happy to say Open Text has agreed to a $60,000 credit for Enron.  
Enron will receive this credit via $30,000 in software and $30,000 credit in 
Professional Services.  



Regards
