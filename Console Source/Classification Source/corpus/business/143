
well, we finally received from counsel for one of the co-defendants - after 
much hounding - the key filings from the previous shultes case . . . and it 
looks like our decision not to pitch in for a lawyer for nsm managment co. 
(&quot;nsm co.&quot;) was a smart move.  it turns out that when the plaintiff moved to 
add nsm co., our co-defendants&apos; attorneys (who we have every reason to 
believe are going to effectively control nsm co&apos;s counsel) actually opposed 
the plaintiff&apos;s motion on the grounds, inter alia, that if the court allowed 
the amendment, THEY would have to bring in enron!  thanks a lot.  now we know 
where the plaintiff got the idea to sue enron.  thankfully, however, 
plaintiff&apos;s counsel disputed that enron was liable and would have to be 
brought in! you can be sure we will figure out a way to get these helpful 
statements into the motions we are drafting.
