
Louise,

Attached is the email I spoke about.

I have had several informal comments from various Originators regarding running into EES at utilities and municipalities. This morning, BPUB informed me that EES is talking to them about sales to their customers under BPUB&apos;s label.

EES is now fully stepping into the Texas wholesale market with this.  Talking to 70 municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for EES to be doing.  This has to be stopped along with EES providing the &quot;Whitepaper&quot; products where they are providing wholesale products to San Antonio and others.  They are making Enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our SIC Codes that we have been working with toward a deal.

I think a meeting needs to be setup between Lavorato and Delainey or at your level to get this fixed.  I have tried working with my peers at EES and they continue to lie to me and keep working customers in our SIC code and even worse with IOU&apos;s and municipals.

Looks like Ader &amp; Co. at work in ERCOT.   I view this as a big problem.   These customers need to be covered by wholesale.   Both of you should take this as a slap in the face.

Tom,

Let me know if this is a possibility.

Thanks.
