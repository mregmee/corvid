You probably will want to be familiar with this website, I can offer some training, but all hourly transmission reservations will need to utilize this website after 10/01/01

First - sorry if you receive this 2 or 3 times and a further apology if you
don&apos;t schedule with BPAT - just want to catch as many of you as I can!

Last week we offered a hands on training of our new Customer Web Interface
(CWI).  At this time there are no plans to offer additional training
sessions.
Our current plan is to have one or two customer meetings the week of 9/17
where we will train a large group (no hands on).  The CWI is out on our web
site for customers to review and play with now (test version).  The
following URL should take you directly to the test site.  If you put the
cursor over the word scheduling you&apos;ll see the link to &quot;Transmission and
Demand Scheduling&quot;.

If you go out and test it (make sure to print out the User Guide) that will
provide you with an opportunity to do some self-training prior to the
September session(s).  The final date for the CWI customer meeting will be
posted on our OASIS.  I would encourage you to sign up for the e-mail
exploder for updates on future CWI meetings (and all TBL business
practices).  Also, the CWI is still a work in progress so newer versions are
being loaded from time to time.  The User Guide is updated at the same time
and includes a new version number each time a change is made. 

To sign up for the email automatic notification (exploder) go to the
www.transmission.bpa.gov/OASIS/BPAT

Select Forums (tab on upper part of the screen); next select Information
Notification; next select E-mail Forum.  Enter your name and email address
and select &quot;Register&quot;

If you have any questions please contact me.  Thank you.
