
 Richard,

My wife Marilyn does research for our law firm on a part time basis, and I
the contribution/indemnity memo that I sent you a few weeks ago, and more
recently she prepared a memorandum on the law concerning whether a non-lead
underwriter can make a separate &quot;reasonable care&quot; showing under our state
securities law even where the lead underwriter may not be able successfully=
 to
carry its own burden of reasonable care.  Marilyn&apos;s memorandum on this subj=
ect
is attached.  This memorandum also surveys the cases on who is a &quot;seller&quot;
under the state law.

These issues, ECT Securities&apos; own reasonable care and ECT&apos;s not having sold
NSM securities to plaintiffs, will all be key points in our Memorandum of
Contentions of Fact and Law now under preparation and, if we get a motion f=
or
summary judgment, will form the principal elements of our opposition to the
motion.
