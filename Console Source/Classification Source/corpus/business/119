
Please find attached the translations of the note we received from the Anti-corruption office as well as the response I prepared.  The crossed out and underlined parts of the latter are changes suggested by Carlos Bastos.  The criminal attorney will not be available for the call since he will be away on a trip.  We are trying to see if his partner Maria Romero Acuna can take his place.
