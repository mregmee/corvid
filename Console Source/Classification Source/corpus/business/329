
Assume ENW is doing for you what you need done during this difficult time.  
 
I know what Sally and her team have been doing for the effort for the last few weeks as well as systems and EOL.  I have been working with Jay Webb, Brad Richter, Sally, Bob Hall, Pickering, etc. constantly on many issues, including EA, and they tell me you are getting what you need.
 
I assume you will call directly if you are not getting anything you need or are concerned or need me personally for anything.
 
Thanks.
