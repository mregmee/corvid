If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, you may call your Help Desk and ask to have it released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
