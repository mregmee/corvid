&gt; Discussions with UC/CSU
&gt;
&gt; Richard Sanders and Bob Williams asked that I provide the following brief
&gt; memo in order to summarize wherer the legislative efforts are at this time
&gt; and how they might impact settlement discussions.
&gt;
&gt; With the close of the first extraordinary session today, a second
&gt; extraordinary session will open on Monday and all the existing but
&gt; unpassed bills will be reintroduced--so we are told.  That means there
&gt; will continue to be at least 2 bills which would substantially protect the
&gt; rights of customers to choose direct access, although both contemplate
&gt; that under varying circumstances the customer could be required to pay an
&gt; exit fee.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A direct access bill will pass this session.  It will likely create the
&gt;
&gt; Any customer who has not been on direct access continuously since before
&gt; January 17, 2001 will have used some power purchased by DWR while being
&gt; charged bundled utility rates far lower than the actual cost.  If these
&gt; customers (like UC) eventually elect to return to direct access they WILL
&gt; be required to pay the shortfall that has accrued while they were on
&gt; bundled service.
&gt;
&gt; Other stranded costs which may be incurred by DWR after the customer
&gt; leaves bundled service for direct access may also be passed on in an exit
&gt; fee.  This would include stranded contract costs if DWR has contracted for
&gt; more long term power than it has customers, as well as any costs related
&gt; to the bond financing intended to pay for the long term power contracts.
&gt; We HOPE that the legislation will have a provision excusing the customers
&gt; from such an exit fee if DWR has not purchased all the net short power by
&gt; long term contracts and DWR can match its supply to the new lower demand
&gt; simply by reducing daily spot purchases.
&gt;
&gt; UC would potentially face the first type of exit fee in any event, it may
&gt; face the second, although there is a possibility of a short &quot;open
&gt; enrollement&quot; period following passage of the bill, which would allow
&gt; customers to switch to DA immediately without paying the second type of
&gt; exit fee.
&gt;
&gt; There may be other exceptions to the exit fees for customers who install
&gt; self generation or distributed generation.  This might affect a few UC
&gt; campuses, but not all.
&gt;
&gt; At least one of the bills might give the CPUC enough discretion to permit
&gt; it to impose onerous conditions on direct access and thereby prohibit it.
&gt; However, this provision is strongly opposed by many customer groups and we
&gt; believe it can be defeated.
&gt;
&gt; We do not know when the direct access legislation will be adopted.  We
&gt; hope within the next month.  We will keep you advised, and please feel
&gt; free to call for an update at any time.
