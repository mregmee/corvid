You are going to love the attached &quot;departure letter&quot; Steve Whitley sent to 
his TVA troops! I think this is an important letter in that it would be very 
interesting to hear Steve under oath describe what he means by &quot;Enron scam 
transactions&quot;. I hope we can have some fun with this...

Ben - thought you might like to see the letter that Steve Whitley sent out
to his organization as he left.  He even mentioned Enron in his remarks!
