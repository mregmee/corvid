of car care from a women&apos;s point of  view...simple.? We know these girls are

changed...and so on.? I was afraid to have  more than two guest speakekrs, as

reach Megan S. who is own nominating  committee.? Lori Van Dike can only meet 
on Sunday, Abi said Sunday is okay  with her...I told Lori plan on meeting
