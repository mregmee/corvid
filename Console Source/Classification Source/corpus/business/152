&gt; Mike,
&gt;
&gt;  Here is the draft research memo that Amanda prepared on some of the
&gt; questions surrounding Senator Dunn&apos;s investigation (some of this you saw
&gt;
&gt; Legislative Committee Subpoena Power
&gt;
&gt; Government Code Section 9401, provides that &quot;a subpoena requiring the
&gt; attendance of any witness before the Senate, Assembly, or a committee may
&gt; be issued by the President of the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly, or the
&gt; chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is
&gt; desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the
&gt; respective house.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et
&gt; seq. and the Govt. Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil
&gt; Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas (C.C.P. 1985, et seq.).
&gt; Therefore, it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt. Code and
&gt; the C.C.P. will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena
&gt; issued by a legislative committee.
&gt;
&gt; Govt. Code Section 9402 provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it &quot;(a)
&gt; states whether the proceeding is before the Senate, Assembly or a
&gt; committee. (b) is addressed to the witness [presumably the custodian of
&gt; records when documents are sought]. (c) requires the attendance of the
&gt; witness at a time and place certain and (d) is signed by the President of
&gt; the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before
&gt; whom attendance of the witness is desired.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or &quot;neglects or
&gt; refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper
&gt; books, papers or document sin his possession or under his control, he has
&gt; committed a contempt.&quot;  Govt. Code Section 9405.   If the contempt is
&gt; committed while the Legislature is in session, Govt. Code Section 9407
&gt; provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or
&gt; Assembly &quot;for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or
&gt; Assembly.&quot;  If the Legislature is not in session, &quot;the superior court in
&gt; and for the county in which any inquiry, investigation hearing or
&gt; proceeding [is] held ... may compel the ... production of books, papers,
&gt; documents and accounts, as required by the subpoena issued by the
&gt; committee, on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court
&gt; asking that the witness be so compelled.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Govt. Code Section 9409 provides that &quot;any witness neglecting or refusing
&gt; to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested....&quot;  It is unclear how
&gt; this provision would (or whether it could) be applied to a subpoena issued
&gt; to the custodian of records of a non-resident company.
&gt;
&gt; Motion to Quash Subpoena
&gt;
&gt; California courts have held, under C.C.P. Section 1985, that a motion to
&gt; quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a
&gt; subpoena duces tecum.  See e.g. People ex rel. Dept. of Public Works v.
&gt; Younger (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 575.  My research has revealed no case in
&gt; which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by
&gt; a motion to quash, but, as noted above, there appear to be only a very few
&gt; cases interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq.   Therefore, it appears that a
&gt; superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by
&gt; a legislative committee (assuming that we want to take the risk of state
&gt; court jurisdiction).
&gt;
&gt; In one early case, the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and
&gt; accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate
&gt; Committee were fatally defective.  Ex Parte McLain (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
&gt; 274.  In McLain, the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served
&gt; upon Mr. McLain, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a
&gt; subpoena calling for the production of various books, papers and
&gt; documents.  Mr. McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer
&gt; questions or produce the documents.  Upon representation of the Committee,
&gt; the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr. McLain to produce the
&gt; documents.  Mr. McLain again appeared before the Committee and again
&gt; refused to produce the documents at which point, an affidavit was filed in
&gt;
&gt; &quot;That, based upon evidence in its possession, the said Senate Interim
&gt; Committee has determined that each of the books, papers, and documents
&gt; specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now
&gt; under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee, and the
&gt; production of such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to
&gt; enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties
&gt; imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California
&gt; pursuant to said Senate Resolution No. 162.&quot; and &quot;That each of the books,
&gt; papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to
&gt; the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee
&gt; and that the production of such books, papers and documents is necessary
&gt; in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the
&gt; duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of
&gt; California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No. 162.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The Superior Court found Mr. McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him
&gt; committed to the sheriff until he produced the records.  The Court of
&gt; Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because &quot;a
&gt; witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty
&gt; of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and
&gt; pertinency of the books and papers called for.  In cases of constructive
&gt; contempt, as is this, not only the order but also the affidavit upon which
&gt; it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the
&gt; offense.&quot;  McLain at 276.
&gt;
&gt; This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting
&gt; C.C.P. 1985, which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege
&gt; material facts rather than conclusory statements.  See e.g. Grannis v.
&gt; Board of Medical Examiners (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 551.
&gt;
&gt; However, cases interpreting C.C.P. 1985 also require the subpoena to
&gt; demonstrate a level of specificity, materiality and relevance to be held
&gt; proper.  See e.g. Pacific Auto Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 273
&gt; Cal.App.2d 61.  It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative
&gt; committees are held to this same standard.
&gt;
&gt; What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued
&gt; against the Enron&apos; custodian of records, an out-of-state resident,
&gt; intended to affect the production of out-of-state Enron documents?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A.  Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt. Code Section 9401,
&gt; to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the
&gt; same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending
&gt; civil state court action?
&gt;
&gt; B.  Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee
&gt; subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing
&gt; subpoenas &quot;generally&quot; (i.e. C.C.P. 1985 et seq.) or those governing
&gt; &quot;deposition subpoenas&quot; (i.e. C.C.P. 2020 et seq.)?  This is a toss-up and
&gt; the answer may well be &quot;both.&quot;  The Government Code reporter sections on
&gt; legislative subpoenas cross references to C.C.P. 1985 et seq. (&quot;subpoenas
&gt; generally&quot;).  However, the &quot;deposition subpoena&quot; provisions (C.C.P. 2025
&gt; et seq.) more closely resemble the &quot;discovery&quot; process that the Senator
&gt; seems to be undertaking.
&gt;
&gt; Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 1985 et seq.
&gt;
&gt; C.C.P. 1989 is entitled &quot;Residency requirements for attendance of
&gt; witnesses&quot; and provides that &quot;A witness, including a witness specified in
&gt; subdivision (b) of Section 1987, is not obliged to attend as a witness
&gt; before any court, judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness
&gt; is a resident within the state at the time of service.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by
&gt; Section 1989.  Section 1987.3 provides &quot;[w]hen a subpoena duchess mecum is
&gt; served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided
&gt; in Article 4 (commencing with Section 1560) of Chapter 2 of Division 11 of
&gt; the Evidence Code, and his personal attendance is not required by the
&gt; terms of the subpoena, Section 1989 shall not apply.&quot;  (Evade. Code 1650
&gt; lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records
&gt; where the business is &quot;neither a party nor the place where any cause of
&gt; action is alleged to have arisen.&quot;)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The rule limiting subpoenas to California &quot;residents&quot; (C.C.P. 1989) does
&gt; not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records
&gt; unless their personal attendance is required. See C.C.P. 1987.3; Amoco
&gt; Chem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd&apos;s of London (1995) 34
&gt; Cal.App.4th 554, 561 fn. 9.  Thus, a nonresident custodian of business
&gt; records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon
&gt; him or her while present in California, by producing the records in
&gt; accordance with Cal. Evid. Code 1560 (delivering copies of the records and
&gt; accompanying affidavit to the court clerk)... [However], C.C.P. 1987.3
&gt; probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a
&gt; business entity subject to California jurisdiction. Otherwise, there would
&gt; be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a
&gt; nonresident.  See Amoco Chem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd&apos;s of
&gt; London, supra.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Civil Procedure &amp; Trials at 1.57-58
&gt;
&gt; Moreover, in one unpublished case, Allee v. King (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
&gt; 1081, the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident
&gt; defendant to produce original out-of-state documents at trial.  In so
&gt;
&gt; &quot;even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial, his presence
&gt; does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the
&gt; out-of-state documents.   Although section 1989 uses the word &quot;witness&quot;
&gt; and does not refer to documents, it has long been presumed under common
&gt; law that documents in other states are outside the court&apos;s territorial
&gt; jurisdiction, so that a court will allow the use of copies or other
&gt; secondary evidence instead of originals.  (See, e.g., Heinz v. Heinz
&gt; (1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 61, 66, 165 P.2d 967, and cases cited therein.)   The
&gt; recognition that out-of-state documents are not subject to the court&apos;s
&gt; process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that,
&gt; absent a statute properly conferring broader powers, the extent of a
&gt; state&apos;s subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is
&gt; coterminous with its borders.  (See 97 C.J.S., Witnesses, S 17, p. 367, S
&gt; 23, p. 375, S 25, p. 380;  81 Am.Jur.2d, Witnesses, S 8, p. 32, S 14, p.
&gt; 39.)
&gt;
&gt; However, the Allee court notes that the &quot;state-border&quot; limitation on
&gt; subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national
&gt; corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are
&gt; out-of-state.  Therefore, even under Allee, if a subpoena was issued to a
&gt; California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents, that Enron
&gt; entity may be obligated to respond.  See Boal v. Price Waterhouse &amp; Co.
&gt; (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore, if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an
&gt; out-of-state officer of Enron, Enron has a very good argument that that
&gt; witness is not obligated to attend under C.C.P. 1989.  It also seems
&gt; probable that, under Amoco and Allele cited above, if a subpoena is served
&gt; on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a non-California Enron
&gt; entity, the subpoena may be invalid.  However, if a subpoena seeking the
&gt; production of documents is served on the custodian of records (or someone
&gt; similarly situated) who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses
&gt; responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in
&gt; California, that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the
&gt; documents.  It is an open question whether that custodian of records
&gt; (employed by an Enron entity in California) would only be required to
&gt; produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California
&gt; entity or whether that person&apos;s obligation would extend further -- to
&gt; produce out-of state documents (i.e. documents from non-California Enron
&gt; entities)  (This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the
&gt; C.C.P. 2020 statutory scheme, see below, but is still open)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 2020 et seq.
&gt;
&gt; a &quot;deposition subpoena,&quot; would a court deciding the enforceability of a
&gt; legislative subpoena treat Enron as a &quot;party&quot; or as a &quot;non-party&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously
&gt; different for the two.  The deposition of a party or party-affiliated
&gt; witness may be noticed (without a subpoena) for a place within 75 miles of
&gt; the witness&apos; residence.  It is unclear how a court would resolve this
&gt; issue.  After all, if a court was resolving the issue at all, an Enron
&gt; entity will have appeared before it. and would be a &quot;party.&quot;  However, it
&gt; seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enron&apos;s
&gt; obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its
&gt; obligations if it was served with a &quot;non-party&quot; subpoena.
&gt;
&gt; subpoena&quot; (requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness), a
&gt; &quot;business records subpoena&quot; (requires only the production of business
&gt; records) and a &quot;records and testimony subpoena&quot; (requires both -- also
&gt; formerly called subpoena duces tecum).  The second of these is the most
&gt; relevant to Enron.
&gt;
&gt; The attendance of an non party out-of-state witness or the production of
&gt; documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the
&gt; deposition is to be taken.  C.C.P. 2026 (b)(2).  Specifically, C.C.P.
&gt; 2026(b)(2) provides &quot;If the deponent is not a party to the action or an
&gt; officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, a party serving
&gt; a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and
&gt; procedures required and available under the laws of the state, territory,
&gt; or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the
&gt; deponent to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document or
&gt; tangible thing for inspection, copying, and any related activity.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Some states issue subpoenas routinely, some require a showing of
&gt; materiality or relevancy, and some require a commission from the court
&gt; where the action is pending.    This question will depend on the law of
&gt; the state when the custodian of records resides.
&gt;
&gt; Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on
&gt; an in-state custodian of records would compel the production of
&gt; out-of-state documents.  Weil &amp; Brown, Rutter Group, California Practice
&gt;
&gt; &quot;It is unclear whether service of a &quot;business records&quot; subpoena on a
&gt; nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records
&gt; located outside the state. ... C.C.P. 2020(d) requires that the subpoena
&gt; be directed to the records &quot;custodian&quot; (or someone authorized to certify
&gt; the records). Whether &quot;custodian&quot; requires actual custody of the records
&gt; is unclear. If it does, serving an officer or agent in California would
&gt; not compel production of business records located elsewhere.... The result
&gt; is different where a &quot;records and testimony&quot; subpoena is used. That
&gt; procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party, not
&gt; merely in his or her custody.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain
&gt; discovery of the requested documents, does the fact that the State is the
&gt; plaintiff (rather than a private party) affect Enron&apos;s prospects for
&gt; removal of the suit to federal court?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal
&gt; question, then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of
&gt; California v. Steelcase Inc. (C.D. Cal. 1992) 792 F.Supp. 84, the case
&gt; should be removable to federal court.
&gt;
&gt; In People of the State of California v. Steelcase Inc. (C.D. Cal. 1992)
&gt; 792 F.Supp. 84, the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought
&gt; suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition
&gt; Statutes (Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code 16720 and 17200).  The District Court
&gt; found that, although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute
&gt; Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies
&gt; located in the county, the unfair competition statutes expressly provide
&gt; that suit be brought &quot;in the name of the people of the State of
&gt; California.&quot;  Id. at 85.  Therefore, for the purposes of the Unfair
&gt; Competition Claims, the Court found that the State of California was the
&gt; real party in interest.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; (1) that &quot;for diversity purposes, a state is not a citizen of itself.
&gt; Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action.&quot;  Id.
&gt; defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in
&gt; interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim, diversity
&gt; jurisdiction does not lie because, under long- established teaching, there
&gt; must be complete diversity, i.e., all plaintiffs must be diverse from
&gt; defendant.   E.g. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 2 L.Ed.
&gt; 435 (1806).   Here, there cannot be complete diversity because, to repeat,
&gt; the State of California is not a citizen of any state. &quot;  Id.
&gt;
&gt; (2) that &quot;[i]ndependent of its failure to meet the complete diversity
&gt; test, the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of
&gt; the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.   The Eleventh Amendment is a
&gt; grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court.   It
&gt; is in &quot;the nature of a jurisdictional bar.&quot;  .... Defendant, relying on
&gt; the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment, contends that this is not a
&gt; &quot;suit ... against one of the United States ...&quot; because the State is the
&gt; plaintiff.   However, since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment
&gt; is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in
&gt; federal court, it should apply equally to the case where the state is a
&gt; plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed
&gt; to federal court by the defendant.&quot; Id.  (internal citations removed).
&gt;
&gt; However, the Court noted that &quot;where removal is predicated on federal
&gt; question jurisdiction, removal is permitted even where a &quot;non-removable&quot;
&gt; claim is joined with the removable claim....&quot; Id.
&gt;
&gt; If a criminal case (price gouging, etc.) is brought against Enron, is
&gt; there any theory (preemption, primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy)
&gt; which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed, stayed or
&gt; removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law
&gt; dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are
&gt; subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine, but no case which considered
&gt; this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically.
&gt;
&gt; Generally, in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal
&gt; action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense
&gt; contractor pending the District Court&apos;s referral of various questions
&gt; regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, the
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Our concern with the district court&apos;s stay and referral is heightened by
&gt; the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution.   While it is true
&gt; that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases,
&gt; see United States v. Pacific &amp; A. Ry. &amp; Navigation Co. (1913) 228 U.S. 87,
&gt; 106-08; United States v. Yellow Freight Sys. (9th Cir.1985) 762 F.2d 737,
&gt; 742, its use clearly interferes with the government&apos;s authority to
&gt;
&gt; &apos;We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against
&gt; a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to
&gt; prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States.   In
&gt; general, the &quot;conduct [of] federal criminal litigation ... is &apos;an
&gt; executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney
&gt; General,&apos; &quot;  In re Subpoena of Persico, 522 F.2d 41, 54 (2d Cir.1975),
&gt; quoting United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.1965) (Wisdom, J.,
&gt; concurring).   Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial
&gt; responsibility.   See Case v. Bowles, 327 U.S. 92, 96-97, 66 S.Ct. 438
&gt; [440-41] 90 L.Ed. 552 (946);  Nader v. Saxbe, 162 U.S.App.D.C. 89, 92-93,
&gt; 497 F.2d 676, 679-80 n. 19 (D.C.Cir.1974);  FTC v. Guignon, 390 F.2d 323,
&gt; 324 (8th Cir.1968).   But &quot;[t]o graft such an exception upon the criminal
&gt; law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative
&gt; will.&quot;  United States v. Morgan, 222 U.S. 274, 282, 32 S.Ct. 81, 82, 56
&gt; L.Ed. 198 (1911).&apos;  United States v. International Union of Operating
&gt; Engineers, Local 701, 638 F.2d 1161, 1162 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied,
&gt; 444 U.S. 1077, 100 S.Ct. 1026, 62 L.Ed.2d 760 (1980)&quot;
&gt;
&gt; United States v. General Dynamics Corp. (9th Cir. 1987) 828 F.2d 1356,
&gt; 1366.  The General Dynamics Court went on to say that &quot;only where an issue
&gt; unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary
&gt; jurisdiction doctrine ... and the referring court has the authority to
&gt; review the agency&apos;s order, can the agency&apos;s regulatory interests be
&gt; required or allowed to subordinate the government&apos;s authority to prosecute
&gt; criminal offenses.&quot;  Id.
&gt;
&gt; In another context, the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of
&gt; administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a
&gt;
&gt; &quot;... neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides
&gt; the kind of &quot;clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will&quot;
&gt; necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the
&gt; traditionally broad scope of the Attorney General&apos;s prosecutorial
&gt; discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged
&gt; violations of the Act. On the contrary, the language and legislative
&gt; history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority
&gt; of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings,
&gt; Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Department&apos;s authority
&gt; to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; United States v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 701
&gt; (1979) 638 F.2d 1161.  See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping
&gt; Industry (D.D.C. 1960) 186 F.Supp. 298, 309 (&quot;though the doctrine of
&gt; primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions,
&gt; it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal
&gt; actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes
&gt; may more often be involved, and the regulatory scheme less affected.&quot;)
&gt;
&gt; Therefore, it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine
&gt; of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against
&gt; Enron, especially since the &quot;criminal penalty&quot; provisions of the Federal
&gt; Power Act are relatively limited.
&gt;
&gt; In addition, at least one court has held, in the civil context, that the
&gt; Federal Power Act was not designed to &quot;shift the forum for the trial of
&gt; anti-trust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to
&gt; the Power Commission [FERC&apos;s predecessor]&quot;  Pennsylvania Water &amp; Power Co.
&gt; v. Consolidated Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Co. (4th Cir. 1950) 184 F.2d
&gt; 552, 562.
&gt;
&gt; I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes
&gt; &quot;double jeopardy&quot; type arguments.  (In other words, if there are possible
&gt; criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at
&gt; issue that was examined by FERC, would State law criminal charges based
&gt; upon the same conduct be precluded.)  Further research on this point after
