
As requested, this is the summary of what we have discussed regarding KAF deal.

HPL nominates 6,200 MMBTU/Day, Apr&apos;02 - May&apos;02, ( 409,000 MMBTU total) of their south Texas production into the Kathleen Anne Field in Wilson County, TX.  And Enron replaces this same volume in the location of their choice.

Scenario 1 plus ENA sells HPL 500,000 MMBTU of storage service with an injection rate of approximately 15,000 MMBTU/Day and a withdraw rate of 37,500 MMBTU/Day to help them serve the swing on the Tuffco contract.


Thanks for your help.
