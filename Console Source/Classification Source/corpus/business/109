
We have determined (Vickers and Tycholiz and Hodge) that no interruptible gas is transacted on line, but certain firm gas descriptions excuse performance on the basis of normal pipeline constraints (without liability).  Therefore, for Phase 1 rollout no EOL interruptible/spot GTC is needed.  In Phase 3 they may consider adding some interruptible products on line.  They do want an over the counter interruptible GTC, which will be prepared.  In any event, all EOL physical gas will be sold online in Phase 1 under the Firm GTC (until masters are signed).  The Phase 1 EOL decision tree will then be if GISB master signed, up to 30 day firm gas under GISB, over 30 under Firm GTC.  If Firm master signed, all gas under Firm master.

Any questions, please call.
