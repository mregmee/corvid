Modern Panchtantra Story

Once upon a time, there was a software engineer who used to develop =
programs on his Pentium machine,=20
sitting under a tree on the banks of a river. He used to earn his bread =
by selling those programs in the=20
Sunday market.=20

One day, while he was working, his machine tumbled off the table and =
fell in the river. Encouraged by the=20
Panchatantra story of his childhood (the woodcutter and the axe), He =
started praying to the River Goddess.
The River Goddess wanted to test him and so appeared only after one =
month of rigorous prayers. The engineer
told her that he had lost his computer in the river.=20

As usual, the Goddess wanted to test his honesty. She showed him a match =
box and asked, ' Is this your=20
computer ?' Disappointed by the Goddess' lack of computer awareness, the =
engineer replied, ' No.'=20

She next showed him a pocket-sized calculator and asked if that was his.
Annoyed, the engineer said 'No, not at all !!'.=20

Finally, she came up with his own Pentium machine and asked if it was =
his. The engineer, left with no option,=20
sighed and said ' Yes.'. The River Goddess was happy with his honesty. =
She was about to give=20
him all three items, but before she could make the offer, the engineer =
Asked her, 'Don't you know that you're=20
supposed to show me some better computers before bringing up my own ?'=20

The River Goddess, angered at this, replied, 'I know that, you stupid =
donkey! The first two things I showed you=20
were the Trillennium and the Billennium, the latest computers from IBM =
!'. So saying, she disappeared with the Pentium!!=20

Moral: If you're not up-to-date with technology trends , it's better to =
keep your mouth shut and let people think=20
you're a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.

ings we try to encourage on The Code Project is sensible and constructive=
 peer review. The way to get better, quickly, is to expose your work to a=
s many people as possible and take note of the feedback you get. However,=
 this system is only as good as the feedback generated so I'd like to ask=
 that for this week, each time you use or read an article, vote and comme=
nt on the article to let the author know what you liked, how you've used =
the code, suggestions for improvement and any bugs you've found.</p>=0D=0A=
=0D=0A<p>On the flip-side we also encourage authors to give themselves as=
 good a chance as possible to get those. If you'd like to see your name i=

FC =0D=0Ainstead of getting real jobs. With the advent of .NET, MFC and C=
++ have taken a =0D=0Aback seat to the other .NET languages but we know t=
here is a huge community =0D=0Astill using and developing C++ and MFC cod=
e. MFC is important and we continue to =0D=0Aencourage Microsoft to pay m=

nd I purchased the award winning "Ultimate Toolbox" suite =0D=0Aof MFC pr=

Once Newton came to India and he watched a few Tamil movies and had his =
head
spinning. He was convinced that all his logics and laws in physics were =
just
a huge pile of junk and apologized for everything he had done.=20

=20

In the movies of Rajanikanth, Newton was confused to such an extent that =
he
went paranoid. Here are a few scenes:=20

1.	Rajanikanth has a Brain Tumor which, according to the doctors can't
be cured and his death is imminent. In one of the fights, the great
Rajanikanth is shot in the head. To everybody's surprise, the bullet =
passes
through his ears taking away the tumor along with it and he is cured. =
Long
Live Rajanikanth.=20
2.	In one of the movies, Rajanikanth is confronted with 3 gangsters.
Rajanikanth has a gun but unfortunately only one bullet. Guess what he =
does?
He holds a knife in his hand and throws at the middle gangster..& shoots =
the
bullet towards the knife. The knife cuts the bullet into 2 pieces and =
kills
both the gangsters on each side of the middle gangster & the knife kills =
the
middle one.
3.	Rajanikanth is chased by a gangster. Rajanikanth has a revolver but
he has no bullets in it. Guess, what he does? Nah.... not even in your
remotest imaginations. He waits for the gangster to shoot. As soon as =
the
gangster shoots, Rajanikanth opens the bullet compartment of his =
revolver
and catches the bullet. Then, he closes the bullet compartment and fires =
his
gun. Bang... And the gangster dies....  =20

This was already too much for Newton to take and he was completely =
shaken
and he decided to go back. But he happened to see a movie for one last =
time
and thought that at least one movie will follow his theory of physics. =
The
whole movie goes fine and Newton is=20
happy that all in the world hasn't changed. Oops not so fast.=20
=20
The Climax finally arrives. Rajanikanth gets to know that the villain is =
on
the other side of a very high wall. So high that Rajanikanth can't jump =
even
if he tries like one of those superman techniques that indian heroes
normally use. Rajanikanth has to desperately kill the villain because =
it's
the climax. (Sir Newton  is smiling since he thinks it is virtually
impossible)..=20


Rajanikanth suddenly pulls two guns from his pocket (Probably a backup). =
 He
throws one gun in the air and when the gun has=20
reached the height of the wall, he shoots at the trigger of the first =
gun in
air, with his second gun. Now the first gun fires off and the villain is
dead.=20
 =20
Newton commits Suicide.

was already too much for Newton to take and he was completely shaken and =

decided to go back. But he happened to see a&nbsp;movie for one last =

villain is on the other side of a very high wall. So high that =
Rajanikanth
can't jump even if he tries like one of those superman techniques that =
indian
heroes normally use. Rajanikanth has to desperately kill the villain =

it's the climax. (Sir Newton&nbsp; is smiling since he thinks it is =

He throws one gun in the air and when the gun has <br>
reached the height of the wall, he shoots at the trigger of the first =
gun in
air, with his second gun. Now the first gun fires off and the villain is =
dead. <br>

Dear mahesh regmee,

I've just signed up to play the NFC Manager 07/08 game at http://espnst=
ar=2Efantasyleague=2Ecom=2E This fantastic game is free to play and sta=
rts scoring scoring on the 15th September 2007=2E=20

There are some great prizes up for grabs if your chosen team of 11 Prem=
ier League stars produce the goods! It's also a great way to add a bit =
of spice to some of those less glamorous fixtures!

So what are you waiting for? Register your team today and then, if you =
think you've got the managerial skills to surpass mine, come and join m=
y own private league (League PIN: 960) where we will see who really kno=
ws their stuff!=20

I've been using Gmail and thought you might like to try it out. Here's
an invitation to create an account.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

mahesh regmee has invited you to open a free Gmail account.

To accept this invitation and register for your account, visit
http://mail.google.com/mail/a-d36c4e4b7f-1470bde454-a9e6a3d262

Once you create your account, mahesh regmee will be notified with
your new email address so you can stay in touch with Gmail!

If you haven't already heard about Gmail, it's a new search-based webmail
service that offers:

- Over 2,700 megabytes (two gigabytes) of free storage
- Built-in Google search that instantly finds any message you want
- Automatic arrangement of messages and related replies into
  "conversations"
- Powerful spam protection using innovative Google technology
- No large, annoying ads--just small text ads and related pages that are
  relevant to the content of your messages

To learn more about Gmail before registering, visit:
http://mail.google.com/mail/help/benefits.html

And, to see how easy it can be to switch to a new email service, check
out our new switch guide: http://mail.google.com/mail/help/switch/

We're still working every day to improve Gmail, so we might ask for your
comments and suggestions periodically.  We hope you'll like Gmail.  We
do.  And, it's only going to get better.

Thanks,

The Gmail Team

Dear Manohar

Get 5 Great Products Today & Save Nearly 50%!

If you'd like 70.00 worth of great products for the low price of
just 37.00 (that's less than $70 US), then read on...

I'm just about to go on holiday to Australia for three weeks (my
longest vacation in a long time). One of my closest friends moved
to Melbourne a couple of years ago, so I'm finally going to visit
him. We're going to be launching an exciting new product when I get
back, but while I'm away, we thought it would be good to create an
irresistible offer on our most popular products

Our Salad playing cards for learning NLP & Hypnotic language
patterns, changing your beliefs & increasing your wealth are our
most popular products by far. We've had literally hundreds of
emails from people saying how they've helped them transform
different areas of their lives

Now, for a short period of time, it's your chance to get them at
the b'est rate ever.


Here's what you're going to get...

1. NLP Coaching Cards (RRP 14.95)

NLP Coaching Cards are for finding out what's going on in someone
else's map of the world, then coaching them to enrich that map.
They are fantastic for setting goals, clearing obstacles, and
shaking up limiting beliefs. They also include techniques for
wiring in the infamous NLP Meta Model, the world's most powerful
information-gathering and problem-solving tool.
 

2. Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards (RRP 14.95)  

Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards are for putting people into trance, and
guiding them to access the resources that will help them make
certain changes. These are great whether you're doing formal
hypnosis, public speaking, or just want to tell more engaging
stories.
 

3. Irresistible Influence Cards (RRP 19.95)

Irresistible Influence Cards are geared towards winning business,
and bringing people around to your way of thinking. They are
focused on discovering people's wants, needs and desires and then
using language in the most influential way to get them to buy your
ideas, products or services.  


4. Instant Happiness Cards (RRP 4.97)

Instant Happiness Cards will help you live richer, happier, more
fulfilling lives, & get more of the results you want. Your health,
relationships, finances, work and even your spiritual life will
benefit & prosper as you play with these cards. Pick one at random
to find the solution to a current problem, or have fun playing the
Instant Happiness card game with friends


5. Instant Wealth Cards (RRP 14.97)

Instant Wealth Cards are for increasing your wealth and achieving
financial fr^edom by changing your psychology around money. These
cards use the patterns of NLP & Hypnotic language to install the
habits, attitudes, beliefs & actions of wealthy people. The more
you play, the wealthier you'll become!
  

All for a small 0ne-time investment of just 37.00+vat (that's
better than half price)

But before you get carried away reading all about these cards and
imagining yourself having these
skills "on tap" I'd just like to tell you what you need to do to
get your discount...

We've made a special "bundle" page to make getting these cards
really easy. All you have to do to get your cards sent straight to
you is:

1. Visit
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

2. Click on the "5 Card Bundle" product
3. Add this special bundle to your cart
4. Head straight to the checkout and pay

Sooner or later most people interested in NLP, hypnosis, coaching
or increasing your happiness want these cards anyway - so to buy
these cards now means you won't have to spend more later.

You don't need me to tell you that the sooner you place your order
the sooner you'll be playing with these cards and learning the
powerful patterns contained within.

But I will tell you that this is a time-limited offer so you'll
need to act fast to benefit

The way I see it is that we both win.

1. I can relax & enjoy my holiday, knowing that my team are
focusing on the new product we're launching later in the year.

2. You get 5 fantastic tools that will accelerate your NLP language
learning, happiness & wealth for much, much less than their real
value

Looking forward to your order!

Bye for now!

Jamie Smart

P.S Remember, you only have until 21st October to claim all five
decks for just 37.00 at
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

P.P.S If you already have some of my card sets then it still pays
to take advantage of this one-off opportunity. They make great
gifts and it's always nice to have a spare set.

P.P.P.S Do your friends a favour and pass this email on to anyone
who's interested in NLP, being influential, hypnosis, coaching,
wealth or anything a bit different.

 Everything from The Code Project has [CodeProject] prepended to the subj=
ect and we now send all list emails from the maillist.codeproject.com dom=
ain. My request for feedback is: are emails managing to get through OK? I=
s there something we could do to make it easier to filter, whitelist, or =
change your subscriptions? Are you finding pesky spamtraps are stopping o=
ur emails to you? We don't want to email anyone who doesn't want to hear =
from us, but conversely we need to be able to email those who <i>do</i> w=
ant to hear from us. Your help helps everyone.</p>=0D=0A<p>And to those o=
f you (both of you) worried about my internet connection last week you'll=
 be happy to know my home line is all fixed and I'm screaming along at 19=
Mbps through ADSL2+. I'm stunned at the speed they can get from copper th=

<h1 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" align="center"><font size="6"> <strong>This Week's Tip...Language  for Results - Part 5 - The Language of Happy Success</strong></font></h1>
<div class="notes"> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Language, particularly in the form of self-talk, is one of the ways that  	human beings direct &amp; focus their attention. In this article, I'll reveal  	some of the most &quot;successful&quot; ways to focus your attention for achieving the  	results &amp; happy success you desire, whatever that may be.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	You are more than you think you are</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	There's an old saying, &quot;The map is not the territory&quot;. A map of New York is  	not the city of New York, doesn't contain all the sounds, sights and smells  	that the city does (thanks <br>
          	goodness!) The city is far bigger, richer and more vibrant than could ever  	be conveyed by a map. A person's map of who they are (their self-concept) is  	not who they really are. You are far more powerful, capable and amazing than  	your map of yourself. Stop for a moment, and think about who you are, what  	your qualities are, your weaknesses and strengths. Then realise that there  	is much more to you than you are aware of. </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	What you focus on increases</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Whatever you focus your attention on over time will increase in your  	experience.&nbsp;What do I mean by focus? The combination of thought and emotion.  	Worry is an excellent way of focusing to bring what you <u>don't</u> want  	into your life. To attract what you <u>do</u> want, imagine having what you  	desire and feel the way you'll feel when you already have it! If you're not  	sure what you've been focusing on, look around! Whatever's been showing up  	in your life over time is what you've been focusing your attention on. <em> 	Change your focus</em> and you'll change your life.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">What you resist persists</span></strong></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">What you focus on  	increases, and resistance is a great way of focusing on something you don't  	want. Some people spend their whole lives running away from certain feelings  	and experiences, but what they resist persists, so the faster they run, the  	closer those things get. But you can stop running. Stop for a moment, and  	ask yourself what you've been resisting. Then ask yourself what would happen  	if you accepted that rather than resisting it. There is nothing to fear, so  	when you stop resisting and <em>accept the feelings</em> that come up, you may 	<em>feel a sense of peace and freedom.</em> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Emotions are amplifiers</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Emotions are the driving force that increases what you focus on. If you want  	to turn a small debt into a large one, you can't just look at your credit  	card bills - you need to worry about them too! Fortunately, this process  	works to help you <em>amplify nice things</em> as well as nasty things. Form a  	mental image of what you wish to increase, then feel an emotion. Emotions  	are powerful, and can move us to take action. The actions we take are an  	expression of the thoughts we have been thinking, and it's emotion that lets  	us know (unconsciously) which actions to take. </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Focus on the 'what', and the 'how' will be taken care of</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	When you focus (thought plus emotion) on what you want, with a positive  	expectation of success, you activate the power of your unconscious mind, and  	the 'hows' start showing up, often without you even figuring them out. This  	is not to say you won't be required to do anything, but you can relax,  	detach from outcome, and <em>trust your intuitive impulses</em> about what to  	do.&nbsp; I used to <em>dream of something really amazing</em> I wanted to have,  	do, create or be, then I'd immediately start thinking of all the reasons why  	it wouldn't work. This was just fear, and there is <u>nothing</u> to fear!  	Like attracts like, so start to <em>feel how you'll feel when your dreams are  	reality.</em> <br>
          &nbsp;</span></p>

Dear Manohar

Get 5 Great Products Today & Save Nearly 50%!

If you'd like 70.00 worth of great products for the low price of
just 37.00 (that's less than $70 US), then read on...

Because of the postal strike we are extending this offer, which has
already been taken up by huge amounts of people, by two weeks.

Our Salad playing cards for learning NLP & Hypnotic language
patterns, changing your beliefs & increasing your wealth are our
most popular products by far. We've had literally hundreds of
emails from people saying how they've helped them transform
different areas of their lives

Now, for a short period of time, it's your chance to get them at
the b'est rate ever.


Here's what you're going to get...

1. NLP Coaching Cards (RRP 14.95)

NLP Coaching Cards are for finding out what's going on in someone
else's map of the world, then coaching them to enrich that map.
They are fantastic for setting goals, clearing obstacles, and
shaking up limiting beliefs. They also include techniques for
wiring in the infamous NLP Meta Model, the world's most powerful
information-gathering and problem-solving tool.
 

2. Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards (RRP 14.95)  

Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards are for putting people into trance, and
guiding them to access the resources that will help them make
certain changes. These are great whether you're doing formal
hypnosis, public speaking, or just want to tell more engaging
stories.
 

3. Irresistible Influence Cards (RRP 19.95)

Irresistible Influence Cards are geared towards winning business,
and bringing people around to your way of thinking. They are
focused on discovering people's wants, needs and desires and then
using language in the most influential way to get them to buy your
ideas, products or services.  


4. Instant Happiness Cards (RRP 4.97)

Instant Happiness Cards will help you live richer, happier, more
fulfilling lives, & get more of the results you want. Your health,
relationships, finances, work and even your spiritual life will
benefit & prosper as you play with these cards. Pick one at random
to find the solution to a current problem, or have fun playing the
Instant Happiness card game with friends


5. Instant Wealth Cards (RRP 14.97)

Instant Wealth Cards are for increasing your wealth and achieving
financial fr^edom by changing your psychology around money. These
cards use the patterns of NLP & Hypnotic language to install the
habits, attitudes, beliefs & actions of wealthy people. The more
you play, the wealthier you'll become!
  

All for a small 0ne-time investment of just 37.00+vat (that's
better than half price)

But before you get carried away reading all about these cards and
imagining yourself having these
skills "on tap" I'd just like to tell you what you need to do to
get your discount...

We've made a special "bundle" page to make getting these cards
really easy. All you have to do to get your cards sent straight to
you is:

1. Visit
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

2. Click on the "5 Card Bundle" product
3. Add this special bundle to your cart
4. Head straight to the checkout and pay

Sooner or later most people interested in NLP, hypnosis, coaching
or increasing your happiness want these cards anyway - so to buy
these cards now means you won't have to spend more later.

You don't need me to tell you that the sooner you place your order
the sooner you'll be playing with these cards and learning the
powerful patterns contained within.

But I will tell you that this is a time-limited offer so you'll
need to act fast to benefit

You get 5 fantastic tools that will accelerate your NLP language
learning, happiness & wealth for much, much less than their real
value

Looking forward to your order! 

Bye for now!

Jamie Smart

 P.S Remember, you only have until 4th November to claim all five
decks for just 37.00 at
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

P.P.S If you already have some of my card sets then it still pays
to take advantage of this one-off opportunity. They make great
gifts and it's always nice to have a spare set.

P.P.P.S Do your friends a favour and pass this email on to anyone
who's interested in NLP, being influential, hypnosis, coaching,
wealth or anything a bit different.

<p align="left">Ms Hall has been training NLP for                                over 25 years, and collaborated with Richard                                Bandler for 10 years (5 of them as his apprentice                                &amp; protege). During that time, their                                collaborations produced many of the most                                well-known developments of NLP, including: <strong>Submodalities,  								The Swish Pattern, The Compulsion Blowout Technique 								</strong>&amp; many others. </p>                              
<p align="left">In addition, she was instrumental in                                the creation of many of the <strong>Sleight of Mouth                                patterns</strong>, one of the most powerful tools there is                                for conversational belief change.</p>                              
<p align="left">It's her brilliance in using and                                teaching language skills that Chris Hall is most                                well known for. With Salad, we want to put the 'L'                                back into NLP, so that's a big part of why we're                                so thrilled to have her training with us. </p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" align="center"><font size="6"> <strong>This Week's Tip...Language  for Results - Part 6 - The Language of Wealth</strong></font></h1>
<div class="notes"> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Did  	you know that wealthy people say different things to themselves than people  	who struggle with money? Your thoughts &amp; ideas guide your feelings &amp;  	actions, so what happens when you imagine having the thoughts, feelings &amp;  	actions of wealthy people? Oh yeah, &amp; the levels of wealth of wealthy people  	too! In this article, I'll reveal some of the most powerful habits,  	attitudes &amp; behaviours of wealthy people, so you can increase your own  	wealth dramatically. <br>
         &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Increase your financial intelligence</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">People  	think you need money to make money, but what you really need is financial  	intelligence. There are books, recordings, websites, videos &amp; games that can  	help you accelerate your learning. And as you begin to increase your  	financial intelligence, you'll start to see opportunities appearing that you  	just wouldn't have noticed before. You may even be surprised at how easily &amp;  	automatically you find yourself making better financial decisions &amp; taking  	even more positive actions. As your financial intelligence increases, so  	will your wealth. </span></p> 
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -36pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask yourself  	&quot;How can I really enjoy increasing my financial intelligence even more  	today?&quot;<br>
         &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Feel how you'll feel when you're wealthy</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">People  	move towards what they think about, &amp; one of the most powerful ways to guide  	your thoughts is to feel how you'll feel when you've got what you want. Stop  	for a moment, &amp; allow yourself to imagine having the wealth you desire. As  	you begin to imagine yourself enjoying the effects of the wealth you've  	created, notice what you see &amp; what you hear. And as you allow yourself to  	do this, feel how you'll feel when you experience that wealth. People like  	what's familiar, &amp; as you start becoming more familiar with feeling wealthy,  	you will unconsciously begin to take steps to bring that wealth into your  	life. </span></p> 
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -36pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine how  	you'll feel when you're wealthy. How will you spend your time? What will you  	think about? Where will your focus be? Feel how you'll feel when you're  	wealthy. <br>
         &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Activate your millionaire motivation</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">If a  	wealthy benefactor offered you 1,000,000 to <em>increase your financial  	intelligence</em>, control your spending &amp; find more ways to generate income,  	would you do it? If you knew that the million pounds will be yours, how  	motivated would you be to <em>take action &amp; start making changes?</em> This  	wealthy benefactor actually exists. It's you! The reality is, you can decide  	now how much wealth you wish to create. You can choose<em> </em>the level of  	millionaire motivation you desire. Then it's just a matter of taking actions  	to <em>move closer to your goal.</em> </span></p>

         &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Produce more than you consume</span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">This  	is the key to creating wealth. If a person consumes more than they produce,  	the result is debt &amp; poverty. But as you discover additional approaches you  	can use to <em>generate more income</em> <em>than you spend</em>, your wealth  	will increase. One way of defining wealth is in terms of how long you can  	pay your expenses for without working. If your passive income (i.e. money  	from sources such as investments, businesses, royalties or property) exceeds  	your expenses, then you are fin@ncially free. What happens when you <em> 	imagine yourself experiencing fin@ncial freedom?</em> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">Do you want to improve your coaching skills? <br>
<br>
         If so, I think you're going to enjoy the <strong>free clip</strong> we've just loaded  to the Salad website. This segment is taken from a recent training session I did  with a group who were making a major investment in professional coach training  (I was invited to do a one-day <strong>NLP Coaching Masterclass</strong> by <em>Barefoot  Coaching</em>, as part of their <em>Chester University</em>-accredited training  course for coaches). <br>
<br>
         We all had a fantastic day, &amp; when I listened to the recordings, I got really  excited. <br>
<br>
         Why?<br>
<br>
         Because for the first time, I've managed to <strong>capture my entire coaching  process</strong> on a digital recording.<br>
<br>
         The free audio is a nine minute clip of me doing <strong>conversational belief  change</strong> with one of the participants, using a few of the language patterns  from my <strong>NLP Coaching Cards</strong>, a dash of ingenuity, &amp; a boatload of humour. <br>
<br>
         This is one of six live demos of NLP Coaching in action that you can hear on the  full recordings, which we've just launched at a special offer price (you'll also <strong>get access</strong> to the coaching process I used to <strong>develop a reputation for  results</strong> as an executive coach - this is the first time I've released this to  the public). <br>
<br>
         But whether you buy the audios right away or not, please listen to the free  download as our gift to you - I really want you to realise that NLP Coaching  doesn't have to be complicated or serious. <br>
<br>

Dear Manohar

Get 5 Great Products Today & Save Nearly 50%!

If you'd like 70.00 worth of great products for the low price of
just 37.00 (that's less than $70 US), then read on...

Because of the postal strike we are extending this offer, which has
already been taken up by huge amounts of people, by two weeks.

Our Salad playing cards for learning NLP & Hypnotic language
patterns, changing your beliefs & increasing your wealth are our
most popular products by far. We've had literally hundreds of
emails from people saying how they've helped them transform
different areas of their lives

Now, for a short period of time, it's your chance to get them at
the b'est rate ever.


Here's what you're going to get...

1. NLP Coaching Cards (RRP 14.95)

NLP Coaching Cards are for finding out what's going on in someone
else's map of the world, then coaching them to enrich that map.
They are fantastic for setting goals, clearing obstacles, and
shaking up limiting beliefs. They also include techniques for
wiring in the infamous NLP Meta Model, the world's most powerful
information-gathering and problem-solving tool.
 

2. Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards (RRP 14.95)  

Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards are for putting people into trance, and
guiding them to access the resources that will help them make
certain changes. These are great whether you're doing formal
hypnosis, public speaking, or just want to tell more engaging
stories.
 

3. Irresistible Influence Cards (RRP 19.95)

Irresistible Influence Cards are geared towards winning business,
and bringing people around to your way of thinking. They are
focused on discovering people's wants, needs and desires and then
using language in the most influential way to get them to buy your
ideas, products or services.  


4. Instant Happiness Cards (RRP 4.97)

Instant Happiness Cards will help you live richer, happier, more
fulfilling lives, & get more of the results you want. Your health,
relationships, finances, work and even your spiritual life will
benefit & prosper as you play with these cards. Pick one at random
to find the solution to a current problem, or have fun playing the
Instant Happiness card game with friends


5. Instant Wealth Cards (RRP 14.97)

Instant Wealth Cards are for increasing your wealth and achieving
financial fr^edom by changing your psychology around money. These
cards use the patterns of NLP & Hypnotic language to install the
habits, attitudes, beliefs & actions of wealthy people. The more
you play, the wealthier you'll become!
  

All for a small 0ne-time investment of just 37.00+vat (that's
better than half price)

But before you get carried away reading all about these cards and
imagining yourself having these
skills "on tap" I'd just like to tell you what you need to do to
get your discount...

We've made a special "bundle" page to make getting these cards
really easy. All you have to do to get your cards sent straight to
you is:

1. Visit
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

2. Click on the "5 Card Bundle" product
3. Add this special bundle to your cart
4. Head straight to the checkout and pay

Sooner or later most people interested in NLP, hypnosis, coaching
or increasing your happiness want these cards anyway - so to buy
these cards now means you won't have to spend more later.

You don't need me to tell you that the sooner you place your order
the sooner you'll be playing with these cards and learning the
powerful patterns contained within.

But I will tell you that this is a time-limited offer so you'll
need to act fast to benefit

You get 5 fantastic tools that will accelerate your NLP language
learning, happiness & wealth for much, much less than their real
value

Looking forward to your order! 

Bye for now!

Jamie Smart

 P.S Remember, you only have until 4th November to claim all five
decks for just 37.00 at
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

P.P.S If you already have some of my card sets then it still pays
to take advantage of this one-off opportunity. They make great
gifts and it's always nice to have a spare set.

P.P.P.S Do your friends a favour and pass this email on to anyone
who's interested in NLP, being influential, hypnosis, coaching,
wealth or anything a bit different.

##             Coaching Language Patterns - 18th October, 2007    ##
####################################################################

Language is an incredibly powerful coaching tool, & the language a
person uses when coaching themselves & others can yield
unexpectedly significant results. This week we'll look at how some
counter-intuitive questions can generate big shifts.

NB: Rapport is essential for these questions!

If you had to teach me how to do this, how would you get me to do
it?

<p align="left">You may already be aware of the success of our Ericksonian Hypnosis Cards TM, and you probably have some ideas about the power of hypnotic language, so I hope that you will be as delighted as I am that we are making all the language patterns from the hypnosis cards available to you in this free e-course (a 29.95 value). <br>
<br>
 If you already own a set of the cards, then sign up for this course as a weekly reminder of the patterns. If you haven't made the decision to buy a deck of hypnosis cards yet, this e-course will give you an insight into just how powerful they are, as well as a chance to start building your skills even before you get your own deck of cards. <br>
<br>
 Either way, this is our way of making these powerful patterns more widely available. By learning these patterns, you can develop a reputation as an extraordinary communicator, able to express yourself with clarity and precision. <br>
<br>
 You'll be able to load your communication with 'subliminal messages' to a person's unconscious mind (a la Derren Brown). <br>
<br>
 You can even get people to go into a trance! How cool is that?!? <br>
<br>
 In addition, when you sign up right away, you will get 'The Top 10 Secrets of Conversational Hypnosis', an e-book worth 19.95, as well as a 7-minute audio demonstration of the patterns. </p><a href="http://www.saladltd.co.uk/hypnosis_course_free_signup.htm"><strong><u>Sign up and get your e-book and audio demonstration...</u></strong></a></td><!--SIDEBOX CONTENT - end--><td style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,Helvetica" background="http://www.leanmarketing.co.uk/box_side/box_line_right.gif"><img width="6" height="6" border="0" src="http://www.leanmarketing.co.uk/box_side/shim.gif" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,Helvetica"><img width="6" height="6" border="0" src="http://www.leanmarketing.co.uk/box_side/box_corner_bl.gif" alt=""></td><td style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,Helvetica" background="http://www.leanmarketing.co.uk/box_side/box_line_bottom.gif"><img width="6" height="6" border="0" src="http://www.leanmarketing.co.uk/box_side/shim.gif" alt=""></td><td style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,Helvetica"><img width="6" height="6" border="0" src="http://www.leanmarketing.co.uk/box_side/box_corner_br.gif" alt=""></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><!--SIDEBOX end--><!--SIDEBOX --><tr><td style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,Helvetica"><br>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">Language is an incredibly powerful coaching tool, &amp; the language a person uses when coaching themselves &amp; others can yield unexpectedly significant results. This week we'll look at how some counter-intuitive questions can generate big shifts.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;NB: Rapport is essential for these questions!<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<strong>If you had to teach me how to do this, how would you get me to do it? </strong><br>
 &nbsp;This question reframes someone from being a victim of their problem, to being the expert. If you had to teach me how to be disorganised, how would you get me to do it? You can even throw in some deliberate mistakes for them to correct. If you had to teach me how to have that airplane phobia, how would you get me to do it? Would you just get me to freak out as soon as I reached the departure lounge? &quot;No, silly. You have to wait until the door's closed - then you start picturing the bolts that hold the wings on.&quot; I'd picture the bolts that hold the wings on? Then what? etc.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;1) Ask someone who you're helping with a problem or challenge &quot;If you had to teach me how to [problem or challenge], how would you get me to do it?&quot; Alternatively, for one of your own challenges, you can ask yourself &quot;If I had to teach someone else how to [your problem or challenge], how would I do it?&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<strong>What would it mean if you were not unhappy [angry, frustrated etc] about that?</strong><br>
 &nbsp;This is a powerful question to ask when someone is upset. Many people believe the only response to certain events is to be angry, frightened, or unhappy. This question challenges that belief and opens their mind to alternatives. &quot;I'm worried that I might go bankrupt.&quot; What would it mean if you were not unhappy about that? &quot;It would mean that I know everything will be alright, whatever happens.&quot; Sometimes it reveals a limiting belief, which you can then challenge. &quot;No matter what I do, I can't lose weight.&quot; What would it mean if you were not unhappy about that? &quot;It would mean I don't care about myself.&quot; How does being happy mean you don't care about yourself?<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;2) For some issue, ask &quot;What would it mean if you were not unhappy [angry, frustrated etc] about that?&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<strong>How would you know if that wasn't true? </strong><br>
 &nbsp;Beliefs aren't really true - they're just ideas. This is a great way of challenging limiting beliefs, because the person has to imagine a new belief to answer the question. &quot;I lost that deal. I'll never be successful.&quot; How would you know if that wasn't true? &quot;I'll always be struggling, because life is hard.&quot; How would you know if that wasn't true? The first step to establishing a new belief is getting someone to think of it. Congratulations!<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;3) For some belief that someone's been perceiving as having limited them, ask &quot;How would you know if that wasn't true?&quot; <br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>

Path=1&products_id=112

2. Click on the "5 Card Bundle" product
3. Add this special bundle to your cart
4. Head straight to the checkout and pay

Sooner or later most people interested in NLP, hypnosis, coaching
or increasing your happiness want these cards anyway - so to buy
these cards now means you won't have to spend more later.

You don't need me to tell you that the sooner you place your order
the sooner you'll be playing with these cards and learning the
powerful patterns contained within.

But I will tell you that this is a time-limited offer so you'll
need to act fast to benefit

You get 5 fantastic tools that will accelerate your NLP language
learning, happiness & wealth for much, much less than their real
value

Looking forward to your order! 

Bye for now!

Jamie Smart

 P.S Remember, you only have until 4th November to claim all five
decks for just 37.00 at
http://www.saladltd.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&c
Path=1&products_id=112

P.P.S If you already have some of my card sets then it still pays
to take advantage of this one-off opportunity. They make great
gifts and it's always nice to have a spare set.

P.P.P.S Do your friends a favour and pass this email on to anyone
who's interested in NLP, being influential, hypnosis, coaching,
wealth or anything a bit different.

##          Tip #226 - Language for Results - Part 8 - A Secret for
Side-stepping Resistance - 25th October, 2007    ##
####################################################################

All language is hypnotic. The hypnotherapist Milton Erickson
famously claimed "I don't have resistant clients." In this article,
you'll discover a powerful tool for bypassing resistance, whether
it's in a sales call, a coaching session, or getting your children
to tidy their room.

And the powerful tool is (drumroll please)... negation. The
unconscious mind doesn't process negation in the same way that we
do consciously. If I tell you not to imagine a fireworks display,
not to hear the sound of a loved ones voice, or not to feel a
deeply pleasurable feeling, your unconscious experiences those

<p align="left">Ms Hall has been training NLP for                                over 25 years, and collaborated with Richard                                Bandler for 10 years (5 of them as his apprentice                                &amp; protege). During that time, their                                collaborations produced many of the most                                well-known developments of NLP, including: <strong>Submodalities,  								The Swish Pattern, The Compulsion Blowout Technique 								</strong>&amp; many others. </p>                              
<p align="left">In addition, she was instrumental in                                the creation of many of the <strong>Sleight of Mouth                                patterns</strong>, one of the most powerful tools there is                                for conversational belief change.</p>                              
<p align="left">It's her brilliance in using and                                teaching language skills that Chris Hall is most                                well known for. With Salad, we want to put the 'L'                                back into NLP, so that's a big part of why we're                                so thrilled to have her training with us. </p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" align="center"><font size="6"> <strong> This Week's Tip...Language for Results - Part 8 - <br>
     A Secret for <br>
     Side-stepping Resistance </strong></font></h1>
<div class="notes"> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">All  	language is hypnotic. The hypnotherapist Milton Erickson famously claimed &quot;I  	don't have resistant clients.&quot; In this article, you'll discover a powerful  	tool for bypassing resistance, whether it's in a sales call, a coaching  	session, or getting your children to tidy their room.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">And  	the powerful tool is (drumroll please)... negation. The unconscious mind  	doesn't process negation in the same way that we do consciously. If I tell  	you not to imagine a fireworks display, not to hear the sound of a loved  	ones voice, or not to feel a deeply pleasurable feeling, your unconscious  	experiences those things, then says &quot;not&quot;. But it's already experienced  	them!<br>
     &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Don't ____ too quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">You're  	going to do it, it's just a matter of how quickly, and we wouldn't want it  	to happen too quickly, now, would we? It's better to savour it! Don't go  	into a trance too quickly. Don't close your eyes too quickly. Don't learn  	these patterns too quickly.&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">A  	couple more examples:</span></p> 
<p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 18pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Don't get  	everything you can out of this tip the first time you read it. There's  	plenty to enjoy the second time through.</span></p> 
<p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 18pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Don't get too  	excited about the things we're going to be doing today. <br>
     	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">I  	wouldn't tell you to ____ because ____.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">I  	wouldn't tell you to, so you don't need to resist against it. And just to  	make sure, I'll give you a reason (people love reasons). I wouldn't tell you  	to enjoy the process of going into trance because it goes without saying  	that you will. I wouldn't tell you to relax the muscles in your arms and  	legs because it's up to you how you prepare to go into trance. I wouldn't  	tell you to practice these patterns repeatedly because you can choose for  	yourself how best to integrate them.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">This  	pattern is fantastic in business contexts, &amp; pretty much anywhere else,  	however...</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">I  	wouldn't tell you to experiment with this pattern in every single context  	you encounter, because only you can decide when &amp; where to use it.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">And  	some more examples:</span></p> 
<p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 18pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">I wouldn't  	tell you to have a lot of fun with these patterns, because you can decide  	how best to enjoy the learning process.</span></p> 
<p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 18pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">I wouldn't  	tell you to take advantage of our special offer, because there's an advert  	later on anyway.<br>
     &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> 	Maybe you haven't ____ yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Maybe  	you have and maybe you haven't. The negation is great for people whose  	natural urge is to resist, and if you have, well that's just my mistake. And  	the &quot;yet&quot; presumes it will happen in the future. Maybe you haven't opened to  	the unlimited possibilities within you yet. Maybe you haven't thought of all  	the ways you can enjoy becoming slim and healthy yet. Maybe you haven't  	imagined all the ways you can use these patterns yet you can begin to now.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Some  	more examples:</span></p> 
<p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 18pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Maybe you  	haven't imagined being really great with language, &amp; getting very positive  	responses from people yet.</span></p> 
<p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 18pt" class="MsoNormal"> 	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Maybe you  	haven't deeply considered the powerful benefits of buying this product yet.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">You  	can ____, can you not?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">When  	you add &quot;can you not&quot; to the end of a sentence, you can agree with it more  	easily, can you not? You can feel parts of your body beginning to relax, can  	you not? You can remember certain pleasant experiences, can you not? You can  	imagine using these patterns in many future situations, can you not?</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">This  	is an example of a tag question (those little mini-questions like &quot;isn't it&quot;  	&amp; &quot;can't you&quot; that people add to the end of sentences, &amp; make them really  	hard to disagree with, aren't they?) In fact, it's a particularly cool &amp;  	spacey example.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Some  	more examples:</span></p>
