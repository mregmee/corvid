hello sir,

doing final yr project as the fulfill ment of major project on Bachelor 
in Computer Engineering.

We chose CORVID the email processor as our final yr project it basically 
filters,classifies and summarizes the email thread that is contained in 
email client ThunderBird.

So, we need a help from you in extracting the noun phrase from email 
thread for summarizing it.It would be so helpful if u suggest some 
algorithms or implementation that could extract noun phrase from email 
so that we could use it in summarizing email.

yours Sincerely
